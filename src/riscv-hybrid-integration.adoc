[#section_cheri_hybrid_ext]
== "Zcherihybrid" Extension for CHERI pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]

{cheri_default_ext_name} is an optional extension to {cheri_base_ext_name}.
Implementations that support {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name}
define a variant of the CHERI ISA that is fully binary compatible with
existing RISC-V code.

Key features in {cheri_default_ext_name} include a definition of a CHERI execution mode, a new
unprivileged register, additional instructions and extensions to some existing
CSRs enabling CHERI features. The remainder of this section describes
these features in detail as well as their integration with the primary base
integer variants of the RISC-V ISA (RV32I and RV64I).

[#section-cheri-execution-mode]
=== CHERI Execution Mode

{cheri_default_ext_name} adds CHERI execution modes to ensure backwards
compatibility with the base RISC-V ISA while saving instruction encoding space.
There are two execution modes: pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] and pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]. Additionally, there
is a new unprivileged register: the default data capability, <<ddc>>, that is
used to authorise all data memory accesses when in
pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}].

The current CHERI execution mode is given by the <<m_bit>> field of <<pcc>> that
is encoded as described in xref:section-cheri-execution-mode[xrefstyle=short].

The CHERI execution mode impacts the instruction set in the following ways:

* The authorising capability used to execute memory access instructions.
In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], <<ddc>> is implicitly used. In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}], the authorising
capability is supplied as an explicit *c* operand register to the instruction.
* The set of instructions that is available for execution. Some instructions
are available in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] but not pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] and vice-versa (see
xref:riscv-extensions[xrefstyle=short]).

NOTE: The implication is that the CHERI execution mode is always pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] on
implementations that support {cheri_base_ext_name}, but not
{cheri_default_ext_name}.

The CHERI execution mode is effectively an extension to some RISC-V instruction
encodings. For example, the encoding of an instruction like <<LW>> remains
unchanged, but the mode indicates whether the capability authorising the load
is the register operand `cs1` (pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]). The mode is shown in the assembly
syntax.

The CHERI execution mode is key in providing backwards compatibility with the
base RISC-V ISA. RISC-V software is able to execute unchanged in
implementations supporting both {cheri_base_ext_name} and
{cheri_default_ext_name} provided that the <<infinite-cap>> capability is installed in <<ddc>> and <<pcc>>
(with <<m_bit,M=0>>, i.e. in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]).
Setting both registers to <<infinite-cap>> ensures that:

* All permissions are granted
* The bounds authorise accesses to the entire address space i.e base is 0 and
top is 2^MXLEN^

[#m_bit,reftext="M-bit"]
=== CHERI Execution Mode Encoding

{cheri_default_ext_name} adds a new CHERI execution Mode field (M) to
the capability format, which is only valid for code capabilities, i.e.
when the <<x_perm>> is set.

* When MXLEN=32, the Mode is encoded in bit 0 of quadrant 1 from the AP field
_even though it is not a permission_ as shown in <<cap_perms_encoding32>>.
** Only quadrant 1 represents executable capabilities, and so it's the only
one which encodes the Mode.
* When MXLEN=64, the Mode is encoded separately; a new <<m_bit>> field is
added to the capability format as shown in
xref:cap_perms_encoding64[xrefstyle=short].
The <<m_bit>> is only valid for code capabilities, otherwise the field is reserved.

NOTE: Mode is encoded with permissions for MXLEN=32, but is not a permission. It is
orthogonal to permissions as it can vary arbitrarily using <<SCMODE>>.

In both encodings:

* Mode (M)={CAP_MODE_VALUE} indicates pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}].
* Mode (M)={INT_MODE_VALUE} indicates pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}].

The current CHERI execution mode is given by the <<m_bit>> of the <<pcc>> and the
CRE bits in <<mseccfg>>, <<menvcfg>>, and <<senvcfg>> as follows:

* The Mode is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] when the <<m_bit>> of the <<pcc>> is {CAP_MODE_VALUE}, *and* the effective
CRE=1 for the current privilege level
* The Mode is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] when the effective CRE=0 for the current privilege level *or* the <<m_bit>> of the <<pcc>> is {INT_MODE_VALUE}

When the <<m_bit>> can be set follows the rules defined by <<ACPERM>>.

[#section_hybrid_ext_instructions]
=== Zcherihybrid Instructions

{cheri_default_ext_name} introduces a small number of new mode-switching instructions to the base RISC-V integer ISA, as shown in <<Zcheri_hybrid_instruction_extension>>.
Additionally, the behavior of some existing instructions changes depending on the current CHERI execution mode.

==== Capability Load and Store Instructions

The load and store capability instructions change behaviour depending on the
CHERI execution mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

The load capability instruction is <<LC>>. When the CHERI execution mode is
pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]; the instruction behaves as described in
xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short].
In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], the capability authorising the memory access
is <<ddc>>, so the effective address is obtained by adding the *x* register to
the sign-extended offset.

The store capability instruction is <<SC>>. When the CHERI execution mode is
pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]; the instruction behaves as described in
xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short].
In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], the capability authorising the memory access
is <<ddc>>, so the effective address is obtained by adding the *x* register to
the sign-extended offset.

==== Capability Manipulation Instructions

A new <<SCMODE>> instruction allows setting a capability's CHERI execution
mode to the indicated value. The output is written to an unprivileged *c*
register, not <<pcc>>.

==== Mode Change Instructions

A new CHERI execution mode switch (<<MODESW>>) instruction allows software
to toggle the hart's current CHERI execution mode. If the current mode in the
<<pcc>> is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], then the mode after executing <<MODESW>> is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]
and vice-versa. This instruction effectively writes the CHERI execution mode
bit M of the capability currently installed in the <<pcc>>.

=== Existing RISC-V Instructions

The CHERI execution mode introduced in {cheri_default_ext_name} affects the
behaviour of instructions that have at least one memory address operand. When
in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}], the address input or output operands may include *c* registers.
When in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], the address input or output operands are *x/f/v* registers;
the tag and metadata of that register are implicitly set to 0.

==== Control Transfer Instructions

The unconditional jump instructions change behaviour depending on the CHERI
execution mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

The jump and link instruction <<JAL>> when the CHERI execution mode is
Capability; behaves as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short].
When the mode is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]. In this case, the address of the instruction
following the jump (*pc* + 4) is written to an *x* register; that register's
tag and capability metadata are zeroed.

The jump and link register instruction is <<JALR>> when the CHERI execution mode
is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]; behaves as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short].
When the mode is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]. In this case, the target address is obtained by adding
the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the *x* register operand, then setting
the least significant bit of the result to zero. The target address is then
written to the <<pcc>> address and a representability check is performed. The
address of the instruction following the jump (*pc* + 4) is written to an *x*
register; that register's tag and capability metadata are zeroed.

{cheri_default_ext_name} allows changing the current CHERI execution mode when
executing <<JALR>> from pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}].

<<JAL>> and <<JALR>> cause CHERI exceptions when a minimum sized instruction
at the target address is not within the bounds of the <<pcc>>. An
instruction address misaligned exception is raised when the target address is
misaligned.

==== Conditional Branches

The behaviour is as shown in xref:condbr-purecap[xrefstyle=short].

==== Load and Store Instructions

Load and store instructions change behavior depending on the CHERI execution
mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

Loads and stores behave as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] when in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]
In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], the instructions behave as described in
the RISC-V base ISA (i.e. without the 'C' prefix) and rely on *x* operands
only. The capability authorising the memory access is <<ddc>> and the memory
address is given by sign-extending the 12-bit immediate offset and adding it to
the base address in the *x* register operand.

The exception cases remain as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] regardless of the CHERI
execution mode.

[#zicsr-section-default]
==== CSR Instructions

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* CSpecialRW is removed. Its role is assumed by
<<CSRRW>>.
endif::[]

{cheri_default_ext_name} adds the concept of CSRs which contain a capability
where the address field is visible in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] (e.g. <<mtvec>>) and the full
capability is visible in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] through a different name (e.g.
<<mtvecc>>). These are referred to as _extended CSRs_.

Extended CSRs have only one address; the access width is determined by the
execution mode.

When <<CSRRW>> is executed on an extended CSR in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]:

* The register operand is an *x* register.
* Only XLEN bits from the *x* source are written to the capability address
field.
    ** The tag and metadata are updated as specified in <<extended_CSR_writing>>.
* Only XLEN bits are read from the capability address field, which are extended
to MXLEN bits according to cite:[riscv-priv-spec] _(3.1.6.2. Base ISA Control in
mstatus Register)_ and are then written to the destination *x* register.

When <<CSRRW>> is executed on an extended CSR in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]:

* The register operand is a *c* register.
* The full capability in the *c* register source is written to the CSR.
** The capability may require modification before the final written value is
determined (see <<extended_CSR_writing>>).
* The full capability is written to destination *c* register.

When an extended CSR is used with another CSR instruction (<<CSRRWI>>,
<<CSRRC>>, <<CSRRCI>>, <<CSRRS>>, <<CSRRSI>>):

* The final address is calculated according to the standard RISC-V CSR rules
(set bits, clear bits etc).
* The final address is updated as specified in <<extended_CSR_writing>> for an
XLEN write.
* In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], XLEN bits are read from the capability address field and
written to an output *x* register. In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}], CLEN bits are read from
the CSR and written to an output *c* register.

All CSR instructions cause CHERI exceptions if the <<pcc>> does not grant
<<asr_perm>> and the CSR accessed is not user-mode accessible.

Accessing a capability CSR other than an extended CSR in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] results in
an illegal instruction exception. These CSRs are listed in
xref:default-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

[#section_hybrid_debug_integration]
=== Integrating Zcherihybrid with Sdext

A new debug default data capability (<<dddc>>) CSR is added at the CSR number
shown in xref:default-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

{cheri_default_ext_name} optionally allows <<MODESW>> to execute in debug mode.

When entering debug mode, the core always enters pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}].

. the mode can be optionally switched using <<MODESW>>.
. the current mode can always be observed in <<dinfc>>.M.

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The mode change instruction <<MODESW>> is new
and the requirement to optionally support it in debug mode is also new.
endif::[]

[#dddc,reftext="dddc"]
=== Debug Default Data Capability (dddc)

<<dddc>> is a register that is able to hold a capability. The address is shown in
xref:default-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Debug default data capability
include::img/dddcreg.edn[]

Upon entry to debug mode, <<ddc>> is saved in <<dddc>>. <<ddc>>'s metadata is
set to the <<infinite-cap>> capability's metadata (with tag set) and <<ddc>>'s
address remains unchanged.

When debug mode is exited by executing <<DRET>>, the hart's <<ddc>> is updated to
the capability stored in <<dddc>>. A debugger may write <<dddc>> to change the
hart's context.

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<dddc>> is a data pointer,
so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses.

[#section_cheri_disable]
=== Disabling CHERI Registers

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* This feature is new and different from CHERI v9's
per-privilege enable bits.

NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The rules for excepting have been tightened here. Also,
it is not possible to disable CHERI checks completely.
endif::[]

{cheri_default_ext_name} includes functions to disable explicit access to CHERI
registers.  The following occurs when executing code in a privilege mode that
has CHERI register access disabled:

* The CHERI instructions in xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short] and
xref:instruction-modes[xrefstyle=short]
cause illegal instruction exceptions
* Executing CSR instructions accessing any CSR added by {cheri_default_ext_name}
 (see <<default-csrnames-added>>) causes an illegal
instruction exception
* Executing CSR instructions accessing any extended CSR
 (see xref:csr-numbers-section[xrefstyle=short]) only allows XLEN access.
* All allowed instructions execute as if the CHERI execution mode is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}].
The mode bit in <<pcc>> is treated as if it was zero while CHERI register access is disabled.

CHERI register access is disabled if XLEN in the current mode is less than
MXLEN, if the endianness in the current mode is not the reset value of
<<mstatus>>.MBE, or if CRE active at the current mode (<<mseccfg>>.CRE for M-mode, <<menvcfg>>.CRE for
S-mode or <<senvcfg>>.CRE for U-mode) is 0.

NOTE: CRE is always enabled in debug mode.

<<mseccfg>>.CRE, <<menvcfg>>.CRE, and <<senvcfg>>.CRE form a single WARL field.
This allows higher privilege software to restrict lower
privilege software access to CHERI register state, and the ability to enter
pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}]. The valid configurations are shown in
xref:xenvcfg-warl-field[xrefstyle=short].

[[xenvcfg-warl-field]]
.Xenvcfg joint WARL field
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="<,<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
|<<mseccfg>>.CRE |<<menvcfg>>.CRE|<<senvcfg>>.CRE|Comment
|0               |read-only 0    | read-only 0   |<<mseccfg>>.CRE=0 completely disables CHERI access
|1               |0              | read-only 0   |<<menvcfg>>.CRE=0 disables access for privilege less than M-mode
|1               |1              | 0/1           |<<senvcfg>>.CRE can be programmed to enable/disable access for U-mode
|===

The WARL programming nature is extended to include UXLEN and SXLEN, as they can
only be programmed to be smaller than MXLEN if the CRE bit active for the current
mode is disabled.

Disabling CHERI register access has no effect on implicit accesses or security
checks.  The last capability installed in <<pcc>> and <<ddc>> before disabling
CHERI register access will be used to authorise instruction execution and data
memory accesses.

NOTE: Disabling CHERI register access prevents low-privileged pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] software
from interfering with the correct operation of higher-privileged pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] software
that do not perform <<ddc>> switches on trap entry and return.

=== Added CLEN-wide CSRs

{cheri_default_ext_name} adds the CLEN-wide CSRs shown in
xref:default-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

==== Machine Status Registers (mstatus and mstatush)

{cheri_default_ext_name} eliminates some restrictions for SXL and UXL imposed in
{cheri_base_ext_name} to allow implementations supporting multiple base ISAs.
Namely, the SXL and UXL fields may be writable.

Setting the SXL or UXL field to a value that is not MXLEN disables most
CHERI features and instructions, as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.

NOTE: If CHERI register access must be disabled in a mode for security reasons,
software should set CRE to 0 regardless of the SXL and UXL fields.

Whenever XLEN in any mode is set to a value less than MXLEN, standard RISC-V
rules from cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec] are followed. This means that all operations
must ignore source operand register bits above the configured XLEN, and must
sign-extend results to fill all MXLEN bits in the destination register.
Similarly, *pc* bits above XLEN are ignored, and when the *pc* is written, it
is sign-extended to fill MXLEN. The integer writing rule from CHERI is
followed, so that every register write also zeroes the metadata and tag of the
destination register.

However, CHERI operations and security checks will continue using the entire
hardware register (i.e. CLEN bits) to correctly decode capability bounds.

{cheri_default_ext_name} eliminates some restrictions for MBE, SBE, and UBE
imposed in {cheri_base_ext_name} to allow implementations supporting multiple
endiannesses.  Namely, the MBE, SBE, and UBE fields may be writable if the
corresponding privilege mode is implemented.

Setting the MBE, SBE, or UBE field to a value that is not the reset value of
MBE disables most CHERI features and instructions, as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.

[#mtdc,reftext="mtdc"]
==== Machine Trap Default Capability Register (mtdc)

The <<mtdc>> register is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] width read/write register dedicated
for use by machine mode. Typically, it is used to hold a data capability to a
machine-mode hart-local context space, to load into <<ddc>>.

xref:mseccfgmodereg[xrefstyle=short].

.Machine security configuration register (*mseccfg*)
[#mseccfgmodereg]
include::img/mseccfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether M-mode has access to capability registers and instructions.
When CRE=1, all CHERI instructions and registers can be accessed.
When CRE=0, CHERI register and instruction access is prohibited for M-mode and lower privilege levels as described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].

The reset value is 0.

[#menvcfg,reftext="menvcfg"]
==== Machine Environment Configuration Register (menvcfg)

xref:menvcfgmodereg[xrefstyle=short].

.Machine environment configuration register (*menvcfg*)
[#menvcfgmodereg]
include::img/menvcfgmodereg.edn[]

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether less privileged levels can
perform explicit accesses to CHERI registers.  When CRE=1, CHERI registers can
be read and written by less privileged levels.  When CRE=0, CHERI registers are
disabled in less privileged levels as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].
CRE is read-only zero if <<mseccfg>>.CRE=0.

The reset value is 0.

[#stdc,reftext="stdc"]
==== Supervisor Trap Default Capability Register (stdc)

The <<stdc>> register is pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] width read/write register dedicated
for use by supervisor mode. Typically, it is used to hold a data capability to
a supervisor-mode hart-local context space, to load into <<ddc>>.

xref:senvcfgreg[xrefstyle=short].

.Supervisor environment configuration register (*senvcfg*)
[#senvcfgreg]
include::img/senvcfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether U-mode can perform
explicit accesses to CHERI registers.  When CRE=1, CHERI registers can be read
and written by U-mode.  When CRE=0, CHERI registers are disabled in U-mode as
described.

* <<senvcfg>>.CRE is read-only-zero if:
** <<mstatus>>.MBE is not the reset value OR
* UXLEN<MXLEN OR
* <<mseccfg>>.CRE==0 OR
* <<menvcfg>>.CRE==0

The reset value is 0.

[#ddc,reftext="ddc"]
==== Default Data Capability (ddc)

The <<ddc>> CSR is a read-write capability register implicitly used as an
operand to authorise all data memory accesses when the current CHERI mode is
pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]. This register must be readable in any implementation. Its reset value
is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

{REQUIRE_CRE_CSR}

NOTE: CRE is not required for the implicit access required by checking memory accesses against <<ddc>>

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<ddc>> is a data pointer,
so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses.
