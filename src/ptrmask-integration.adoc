== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} with Pointer Masking

The pointer masking extensions SSnpm, Sspm and Supm are compatible with {cheri_default_ext_name}.

In {cheri_int_mode_name} all data addresses are integer pointers, which
are interpreted as being XLEN-wide, and may be subject to pointer masking.
All data accesses are checked against <<ddc>> which is unaffected by
pointer masking. Therefore no capability bounds encoding is affected.

In {cheri_cap_mode_name} all pointers are capabilities, and the bounds
encoding relies on XLEN-wide addresses, and therefore the definitions
will need to be updated to be usable for pointer masking.

Therefore supporting pointer masking in {cheri_cap_mode_name} is future work.
