== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} with Pointer Masking

The pointer masking extensions Smmpm, Smnpm, SSnpm, Sspm and Supm are compatible with both {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name}.
Whenever pointer masking is enabled, all bounds decoding and bounds checks are affected.

NOTE: The suggestion in this section is based on the pointer masking approach from Morello but with changes
to sign extension and to address the dynamic nature of bit masking.
Further evaluation on RISCV, especially for {cheri_cap_mode_name}, is still required.

When bounds are <<section_cap_encoding,encoded or decoded>>, a masked but _not_ sign extended address is used.
Changing how many bits are masked can therefore change the interpretation of the bounds of a capability,
both for the purpose of implicit accesses via bounds checks and any instructions that report the bounds of a capability.
Apart from treating high address bits as 0, there are no other changes to bounds decode,
which are still based on MXLEN, not the new effectively addressable space.
That is, the maximum length of a capability does not change, and
it is not invalid to have a capability that covers a longer range than could be actually be addressed with pointer masking enabled (such as one that covers the entire MXLEN address space).
For the <<section_cap_representable_check, representable range check>>, both the original and new address
are masked.
Bounds setting instructions also mask the address in the same way.

NOTE: Because dynamically changing the number of masked bits changes the interpretation of a capability,
software must take the same care when sharing capabilities between address spaces with differing pointer masking
as it generally must when sharing capabilities between address spaces with different page mappings.

Any address that is checked against a capability (whether via loads/stores in {cheri_int_mode_name} or {cheri_cap_mode_name}),
is also first subject to the same masking as bounds decode (masking without extension).
After any CHERI operations, the final access address is still subject to as much sign extension as the masking extensions mandate.
