== Quick Start

This document describes the RISC-V extensions for supporting CHERI capabilities in hardware.
Capabilities can be used to provide memory safety, mitigating up to 70% of memory safety issues cite:[msrc-cheri-eval], as well as to provide efficient compartmentalization.
The extensions are split into the core features required for a working capability system ({cheri_base_ext_name}), and features required to support a mix-and-match of binaries compiled for CHERI and unchanged binaries ({cheri_default_ext_name}).
Some other smaller extensions are described that provide additional functionality relevant to CHERI.

=== Capability Properties

Capabilities are 2*XLEN (which we call CLEN) bit structures, containing all the information required to identify and authorize access to a region of memory.
This includes:

 * An XLEN bit address, describing where the capability currently points.

 * Bounds: a _base_ and a _top_ address, describing the range of addresses the capability can be used to access.

 * Permissions (read, write, execute, read capability, ...) describing the kinds of accesses the capability can be used for.

 * Sealing information: a capability can be _sealed_, restricting it to only be used or modified in particular ways.

A one-bit integrity tag is stored alongside a capability: this is maintained by hardware and cannot be directly modified by software.
It indicates whether the capability is valid.
An initial <<infinite-cap>> capability with access to all of memory with all permissions is provided in system registers on reset: all valid capabilities are derived from it.
This is the only way to obtain a valid capability: no software, even machine mode, can _forge_ a capability.

=== Added State

A CHERI core adds state to allow capabilities to be used from within registers, and to ensure they are not corrupted as they flow through the system.
This means the following state is added:

* Metadata within architectural registers: XLEN-wide integer registers (e.g. `sp`, `a0`) are all extended with another XLEN bits of capability metadata, including bounds and permissions.
  The resulting CLEN bits in full form a capability, and we refer to the same register prefixed with a `c`, i.e. `csp`, `ca0`.
  The integer part of the register is interpreted as the address field of the capability.
  The zero register is extended with zero metadata and a cleared tag: this is called the <<null-cap>> capability.
  As well as general purpose registers, system registers that store addresses are extended to contain capabilities.
  For example, <<mtvec>> is extended to a capability version <<mtvecc>> (the machine trap vector capability) to allow the code bounds to be changed on an exception.

* Tags in registers, caches, and memory:

** Every register has a one-bit tag, indicating whether the capability in the register is valid to be dereferenced.
   Among other reasons, this tag is cleared if the register is written as an integer.

** The tags are also tracked through the memory subsystem: every aligned CLEN-bits wide region has a non-addressable one-bit tag, which the hardware manages atomically with the data.
   The tag is cleared if the memory region is ever written other than using a capability store from a tagged capability register.
   Any caches must preserve this abstraction.

=== Checking Memory

Every memory access performed by a CHERI core must be authorized by a capability.
It is explicitly defined for every instruction where to find the capability to check against.
In _purecap_ code, where all pointers are individual capabilities, the capability and address are used together, so e.g. `lw t0, 16(csp)` loads a word from memory, getting the address and bounds from the `csp` register.
For code that has not yet been fully adapted to CHERI (_hybrid_ code), the processor can run in a pointer mode (not to be confused with a privilege mode) where the authorizing capability is instead taken from a special CSR: the default data capability (<<ddc>>).

Instruction fetch is also authorized by a capability: the program counter capability (<<pcc>>) which extends PC.
This allows code fetch to be bounded, preventing a wide range of attacks that subvert control flow with integer data.
Where {cheri_default_ext_name} is supported, the <<pcc>> also contains the <<m_bit,mode bit>> indicating whether the processor is running in integer or capability pointer mode.
Changing the bounds used for instruction fetch or the pointer mode can be as easy as performing a capability-based jump (<<JALR>> in capability pointer mode).
<<MODESW_CAP>> and <<MODESW_INT>> instructions are also added to allow cheap mode switching.

Exception codes are added for CHERI-specific exceptions on fetch, jumps, and memory access.
No other exception paths are added: in particular, capability manipulations do not trap, but may clear the tag on the result capability if the operation is not permitted.

=== Added Instructions

The added instructions can be split into the following categories:

* Capability manipulations (e.g. <<CADD>>, <<SCBNDS>>): for security, capabilities can only be modified in restricted ways.
  Special instructions are provided to perform these allowed operations, for example _shrinking_ the bounds or _reducing_ the permissions.
  Any attempt to manipulate capabilities without using the instructions clears the tag, rendering them unusable for accessing memory.

* Capability inspection (e.g. <<GCBASE>>, <<GCPERM>>): capability fields (for example the _bounds_ describing what addresses the capability gives access to) are stored compressed in registers and memory.
  These instructions give convenient access to allow software to query them.

* Memory access instructions (e.g. <<LC>>, <<SC>>): capabilities must be read from and written to memory atomically along with their tag.
  Instructions are added to perform these wider accesses, allowing capability flow between the memory and the register file.

=== Existing Instructions

Existing RISC-V instructions are largely unmodified: in {cheri_int_mode_name}, there is binary compatibility.
Instructions that access memory, as well as branches and jumps, are automatically checked against <<ddc>> and <<pcc>>, raising an exception if the checks fail.
However, <<ddc>> and <<pcc>> are reset to <<infinite-cap>> capabilities, meaning the checks will always pass on systems that have not written to CHERI system registers.

In {cheri_cap_mode_name}, these instructions are instead modified to check against the full capability from the address register (e.g. `lw t0, 16(csp)`).
In some cases, they are also changed to return a full capability value, e.g. <<AUIPC>> will return the full <<pcc>> including the metadata.
