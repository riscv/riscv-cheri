== "Zstid Extension for Thread Identification

{tid_ext_name} is an optional extension to the RISC-V base ISA.
Implementations that support {cheri_base_ext_name} and {tid_ext_name}.
define a variant of the CHERI ISA that allows for more efficient
software compartmentalization of CHERI programs.

=== Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

{tid_ext_name} adds two new CSRs to implement a trusted thread
identifier (TID) used in compartmentalization. These CSRs are listed in
xref:tid-scsrnames-added[xrefstyle=short] and
xref:tid-ucsrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

=== Supervisor-Level and Unprivileged CSRs

[#stid,reftext="stid"]
==== Supervisor Thread Identifier (stid)

The <<stid>> register is an SXLEN-bit read-write register. It is used to
identify the current thread. The reset value of this register is
UNSPECIFIED.

include::img/stidreg.edn[]


[#utid,reftext="utid"]
==== User Thread Identifier (utid)

The <<utid>> register is an UXLEN-bit read-only register. It is a read-only
copy of the <<stid>> register. The reset value of this register is
UNSPECIFIED.

When {cheri_base_ext_name} is implemented, the {tid_ext_name} CSRs are
extended as follows:

[#stidc,reftext="stidc"]
==== Supervisor Thread Identifier Capability (stidc)

The <<stidc>> register is an CLEN-bit read-write capability register.
It is the capability extension of the <<stid>> register.
It is used to identify the current thread. On reset the tag of <<stidc>>
will be set to 0 and the remainder of the data is UNSPECIFIED.

include::img/stidcreg.edn[]


[#utidc,reftext="utidc"]
==== User Thread Identifier Capability (utidc)

The <<utidc>> register is an CLEN-wide read-only capability register.
It is the capability extension of the <<utid>> register. <<utidc>> is
a read-only copy of the <<stidc>> register. On reset the tag of <<utidc>>
will be set to 0 and the remainder of the data is UNSPECIFIED.

[#CHERI_COMP,reftext="CHERI Compartmentalization]
=== CHERI Compartmentalization

This section describes how this specification enables support for
compartmentalization for CHERI systems. Compartmentalization seeks
to separate the privileges between different protection units, e.g.,
two or more libraries. Code can be separated by sentries, which allow
for giving out code capabilities to untrusted code where the untrusted
code can only call the code capability, but not modify it. Sentries can
be called from different threads and thus there needs to be a way of
identifying the current thread. While identifying the current thread
can be done by privileged code, e.g., the kernel, the implied performance
overhead of this is not bearable for CHERI systems with many compartments.

The RISC-V ABI includes a _thread pointer (tp)_ register, which is not
usable for the purpose of reliably identifying the current thread because
the tp register is a general purpose register and can be changed arbitrarily
by untrusted code. Therefore, this specification offers two additional CSRs
that facilitate a trusted source for the thread ID. The supervisor thread
identifier (<<stid>>) register is readable and writeable with <<asr_perm>>
from the supervisor mode allowing to change the thread ID on a context switch.
The user thread identifier (<<utid>>) exposes the current value of <<stid>> as a
read-only copy.

This extension extends <<stid>> to its capability variant <<stidc>> and
<<utid>> to its capability variant <<utidc>>. This presents software with the
freedom to still use these registers with capabilities or leave the metadata
untouched and only use the registers to storage integers.
