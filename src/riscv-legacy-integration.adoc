== "Zcheri_legacy" Extension for CHERI Legacy Mode

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* This feature is new and different from CHERI v9's
per-privilege enable bits.
endif::[]

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} is an optional extension to {cheri_base_ext_name}.
Implementations that support {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_legacy_ext_name}
define a variant of the CHERI ISA that is fully binary compatible with
existing RISC-V code.

Key features in {cheri_legacy_ext_name} include a definition of a CHERI execution mode, a new
unprivileged register, additional instructions and extensions to some existing
CSRs enabling disable CHERI features. The remainder of this section describes
these features in detail as well as their integration with the primary base
integer variants of the RISC-V ISA (RV32I and RV64I).

=== CHERI Execution Mode

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds CHERI execution modes to ensure backwards
compatibility with the base RISC-V ISA while saving instruction encoding space.
There are two execution modes: _Capability_ and _Legacy_. Additionally, there
is a new unprivileged register: the default data capability, <<ddc>>, that is
used to authorise all data memory accesses when the current CHERI mode is
Legacy.

The current CHERI execution mode is given by the current privilege level and
the value of the CME bit in <<mseccfg>>, <<menvcfg>>, and <<senvcfg>> for
M-mode, S-mode, and U-mode, respectively.

The CHERI execution mode impacts the instruction set in the following ways:

* The authorising capability used to execute memory access instructions.
In Legacy mode, <<ddc>> is implicitly used. In Capability mode, the authorising
capability is supplied as an explicit *c* operand register to the instruction.
* The set of instructions that is available for execution. Some instructions
are available in Legacy mode but not Capability mode and vice-versa (see
xref:riscv-extensions[xrefstyle=short]).

NOTE: The implication is that the CHERI execution mode is always Capability on
implementations that support {cheri_base_ext_name}, but not
{cheri_legacy_ext_name}.

The CHERI execution mode is effectively an extension to some RISC-V instruction
encodings. For example, the encoding of an instruction like <<LW>> remains
unchanged, but the mode indicates whether the capability authorising the load
is the register operand `cs1` (Capability mode). The mode is shown in the assembly
syntax.

The CHERI execution mode is key in providing backwards compatibility with the
base RISC-V ISA. RISC-V software is able to execute unchanged in
implementations supporting both {cheri_base_ext_name} and
{cheri_legacy_ext_name} provided that the configured CHERI execution mode is
Legacy by setting CME=0 in <<mseccfg>>, <<menvcfg>> or <<senvcfg>> as required,
and the <<infinite-cap>> capability is installed in the <<pcc>> and <<ddc>>
such that:

* Tags are set
* Capabilities are unsealed
* All permissions are granted
* The bounds authorise accesses to the entire address space i.e base is 0 and
top is 2^XLENMAX^

[#section_legacy_ext_instructions]
=== Zcheri_legacy Instructions

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} does not introduce new instructions to the base RISC-V
integer ISA. However, the behavior of some existing instructions changes
depending on the current CHERI execution mode.

==== Capability Load and Store Instructions

The load and store capability instructions change behaviour depending on the
CHERI execution mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

The load capability instruction is <<LC>>. When the CHERI execution mode is
Capability; the instruction behaves as described in
xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short].
In legacy mode, the capability authorising the memory access
is <<ddc>>, so the effective address is obtained by adding the *x* register to
the sign-extended offset.

The store capability instruction is <<SC>>. When the CHERI execution mode is
Capability; the instruction behaves as described in
xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short].
In legacy mode, the capability authorising the memory access
is <<ddc>>, so the effective address is obtained by adding the *x* register to
the sign-extended offset.

=== Existing RISC-V Instructions

The CHERI execution mode introduced in {cheri_legacy_ext_name} affects the
behaviour of instructions that have at least one memory address operand. When
in Capability mode, the address input or output operands may include *c* registers.
When in Legacy mode, the address input or output operands are *x/f/v* registers;
the tag and metadata of that register are implicitly set to 0.

==== Control Transfer Instructions

The unconditional jump instructions change behaviour depending on the CHERI
execution mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

The jump and link instruction <<JAL>> when the CHERI execution mode is
Capability; behaves as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short].
When the mode is Legacy. In this case, the address of the instruction
following the jump (*pc* + 4) is written to an *x* register; that register's
tag and capability metadata are zeroed.

The jump and link register instruction is <<JALR>> when the CHERI execution mode
is Capability; behaves as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short].
When the mode is Legacy. In this case, the target address is obtained by adding
the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the *x* register operand, then setting
the least significant bit of the result to zero. The target address is then
written to the <<pcc>> address and a representability check is performed. The
address of the instruction following the jump (*pc* + 4) is written to an *x*
register; that register's tag and capability metadata are zeroed.

<<JAL>> and <<JALR>> cause CHERI exceptions when a minimum sized instruction
at the target address is not within the bounds of the <<pcc>>. An
instruction address misaligned exception is raised when the target address is
misaligned.

==== Conditional Branches

The behaviour is as shown in xref:condbr-purecap[xrefstyle=short].

==== Load and Store Instructions

Load and store instructions change behavior depending on the CHERI execution
mode although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

Loads and stores behave as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] when the CHERI execution
mode is Capability. In Legacy mode, the instructions behave as described in
the RISC-V base ISA (i.e. without the 'C' prefix) and rely on *x* operands
only. The capability authorising the memory access is <<ddc>> and the memory
address is given by sign-extending the 12-bit immediate offset and adding it to
the base address in the *x* register operand.

The exception cases remain as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] regardless of the CHERI
execution mode.

[#zicsr-section-legacy]
==== CSR Instructions

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* CSpecialRW is removed. Its role is assumed by
<<CSRRW>>.
endif::[]

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds the concept of CSRs which contain a capability
where the address field is visible to legacy code (e.g. <<mtvec>>) and the
full capability is also visible through an alias (e.g. <<mtvecc>>). These
are referred to as _extended CSRs_.

Extended CSRs are accessible through two addresses, and the address determines
the access width.

When the XLEN-bit alias is used by <<CSRRW>>:

* The register operand is an *x* register.
* Only XLEN bits from the *x* source are written to the capability address
field.
    ** The tag and metadata are updated as specified in <<extended_CSR_writing>>.
* Only XLEN bits are read from the capability address field, which are extended
to XLENMAX bits according to cite:[riscv-priv-spec] _(3.1.6.2. Base ISA Control in
mstatus Register)_ and are then written to the destination *x* register.

When the CLEN-bit alias is used by <<CSRRW>>:

* The register operand is a *c* register.
* The full capability in the *c* register source is written to the CSR.
** The capability may require modification before the final written value is
determined (see <<extended_CSR_writing>>).
* The full capability is written to destination *c* register.

When either alias is used by another CSR instruction (<<CSRRWI>>, <<CSRRC>>,
<<CSRRCI>>, <<CSRRS>>, <<CSRRSI>>):.

* The final address is calculated according to the standard RISC-V CSR rules
(set bits, clear bits etc).
* The final address is updated as specified in <<extended_CSR_writing>> for an
XLEN write.
* XLEN bits are read from the capability address field and written to an output
*x* register.

There is _no distinction_ between accessing either alias in this case - the
XLEN access is always performed, and the assembly syntax always uses *x*
registers.

All CSR instructions cause CHERI exceptions if the <<pcc>> does not grant
<<asr_perm>> and the CSR accessed is not user-mode accessible.

[#section_legacy_debug_integration]
=== Integrating Zcheri_legacy with Sdext

A new debug default data capability (<<dddc>>) CSR is added at the CSR number
shown in xref:legacy-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

[#dddc,reftext="dddc"]
=== Debug Default Data Capability (dddc)

<<dddc>> is a register that is able to hold a capability. The address is shown in
xref:legacy-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Debug default data capability
include::img/dddcreg.edn[]

Upon entry to debug mode, <<ddc>> is saved in <<dddc>>. <<ddc>>'s metadata is
set to the <<infinite-cap>> capability's metadata and <<ddc>>'s address remains
unchanged.

When debug mode is exited by executing <<DRET>>, the hart's <<ddc>> is updated to
the capability stored in <<dddc>>. A debugger may write <<dddc>> to change the
hart's context.

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<dddc>> is a data pointer,
so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses.

[#section_cheri_disable]
=== Disabling CHERI Registers

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The rules for excepting have been tightened here. Also,
it is not possible to disable CHERI checks completely.
endif::[]

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} includes functions to disable explicit access to CHERI
registers.  The following occurs when executing code in a privilege mode that
has CHERI register access disabled:

* The CHERI instructions in xref:section_cap_instructions[xrefstyle=short] (and
xref:instruction-modes[xrefstyle=short] if {cheri_mode_ext_name} is supported)
cause illegal instruction exceptions
* Executing CSR instructions accessing any capability wide CSR
addresses (xref:csr-numbers-section[xrefstyle=short]) cause illegal
instruction exceptions
* All allowed instructions execute as if the CHERI execution mode is Legacy.
The CME bits in <<menvcfg>> and <<senvcfg>> are zero whilst
CHERI register access is disabled.

CHERI register access is disabled if XLEN in the current mode is less than
XLENMAX, if the endianness in the current mode is not the reset value of
<<mstatus>>.MBE, or if CRE active at the current mode (<<menvcfg>>.CRE for
S-mode or <<senvcfg>>.CRE for U-mode) is 0.

<<menvcfg>>.CRE, <<menvcfg>>.CME, <<senvcfg>>.CRE and <<senvcfg>>.CME form a
single WARL field. This allows higher privilege software to restrict lower
privilege software access to CHERI register state, and the ability to enter
capability mode. The valid configurations are shown in
xref:xenvcfg-warl-field[xrefstyle=short].

[[xenvcfg-warl-field]]

|0              | RO 0          | RO 0          | RO 0          |<<menvcfg>>.CRE=0 disables all other state

|===

The WARL programming nature is extended to include UXLEN and SXLEN, as they can
only be programmed to be smaller than MXLEN if the CRE bit active for the current
mode is disabled.

Disabling CHERI register access has no effect on implicit accesses or security
checks.  The last capability installed in <<pcc>> and <<ddc>> before disabling
CHERI register access will be used to authorise instruction execution and data
memory accesses.

NOTE: Disabling CHERI register access prevents a low-privileged Legacy mode
from interfering with the correct operation of higher-privileged Legacy modes
that do not perform <<ddc>> switches on trap entry and return.

=== Added CLEN-wide CSRs

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds the CLEN-wide CSRs shown in
xref:legacy-csrnames-added[xrefstyle=short].

|===

==== Machine ISA Register (misa)

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} eliminates some restrictions for MXL imposed in
{cheri_base_ext_name} to allow implementations supporting multiple base ISAs.
Namely, the MXL field, that encodes the native base integer ISA width as shown
in xref:misa_mxl_field[xrefstyle=short], may be writable.

Setting the MXL field to a value that is not XLENMAX disables most CHERI
features and instructions as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].

==== Machine Status Registers (mstatus and mstatush)

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} eliminates some restrictions for SXL and UXL imposed in
{cheri_base_ext_name} to allow implementations supporting multiple base ISAs.
Namely, the SXL and UXL fields may be writable.

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} requires that lower-privilege modes have XLEN settings
less than or equal to the next-higher privilege mode. WARL field behaviour
restricts programming so that it is not possible to program MXL, SXL or UXL
to violate this rule.

Setting the SXL or UXL field to a value that is not XLENMAX disables most
CHERI features and instructions, as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.

NOTE: If CHERI register access must be disabled in a mode for security reasons,
software should set CRE to 0 regardless of the SXL and UXL fields.

Whenever XLEN in any mode is set to a value less than XLENMAX, standard RISC-V
rules from cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec] are followed. This means that all operations
must ignore source operand register bits above the configured XLEN, and must
sign-extend results to fill the entire widest supported XLEN in the destination
register. Similarly, *pc* bits above XLEN are ignored, and when the *pc* is
written, it is sign-extended to fill XLENMAX. The integer writing rule from CHERI
is followed, so that every register write also zeroes the metadata and tag of
the destination register.

However, CHERI operations and security checks will continue using the entire
hardware register (i.e. CLEN bits) to correctly decode capability bounds.

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} eliminates some restrictions for MBE, SBE, and UBE
imposed in {cheri_base_ext_name} to allow implementations supporting multiple
endiannesses.  Namely, the MBE, SBE, and UBE fields may be writable if the
corresponding privilege mode is implemented.

Setting the MBE, SBE, or UBE field to a value that is not the reset value of
MBE disables most CHERI features and instructions, as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.

[#mtdc,reftext="mtdc"]
==== Machine Trap Default Capability Register (mtdc)

The <<mtdc>> register is capability width read/write register dedicated
for use by machine mode. Typically, it is used to hold a data capability to a
machine-mode hart-local context space, to load into <<ddc>>.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

value is the <<null-cap>> capability.

.Machine-mode trap data capability register
include::img/mtdcreg.edn[]

[#mseccfg,reftext="mseccfg"]
==== Machine Security Configuration Register (mseccfg)

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds a new enable bit to <<mseccfg>> as shown in
xref:mseccfgmodereg[xrefstyle=short].

.Machine security configuration register (*mseccfg*)
[#mseccfgmodereg]
include::img/mseccfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Mode Enable (CME) bit controls whether M-mode executes in Capability
or Legacy mode. When CME=1, the CHERI execution mode is Capability. When CME=0,
the mode is Legacy.  Its reset value is 0.

[#menvcfg,reftext="menvcfg"]
==== Machine Environment Configuration Register (menvcfg)

{cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds two new enable bits to <<menvcfg>> as shown in
xref:menvcfgmodereg[xrefstyle=short].

.Machine environment configuration register (*menvcfg*)
[#menvcfgmodereg]
include::img/menvcfgmodereg.edn[]

The CHERI Mode Enable (CME) bit controls whether less privileged levels (e.g.
S-mode and U-mode) execute in Capability or Legacy mode. When CME=1, the
CHERI execution mode is Capability. When CME=0, the mode is Legacy.

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether less privileged levels can
perform explicit accesses to CHERI registers.  When CRE=1, CHERI registers can
be read and written by less privileged levels.  When CRE=0, CHERI registers are
disabled in less privileged levels as described in
xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].

CME and CRE form part of a WARL field as shown in xref:xenvcfg-warl-field[xrefstyle=short].

[#stdc,reftext="stdc"]
==== Supervisor Trap Default Capability Register (stdc)

The <<stdc>> register is capability width read/write register dedicated
for use by supervisor mode. Typically, it is used to hold a data capability to
a supervisor-mode hart-local context space, to load into <<ddc>>.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Supervisor trap data capability register (*stdc*)

[#senvcfg,reftext="senvcfg"]
==== Supervisor Environment Configuration Register (senvcfg)

The *senvcfg* register operates as described in the RISC-V Privileged
Specification. {cheri_legacy_ext_name} adds two new enable bits as shown in
xref:senvcfgreg[xrefstyle=short].

.Supervisor environment configuration register (*senvcfg*)
[#senvcfgreg]
include::img/senvcfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Mode Enable (CME) bit controls whether U-mode executes in Capability
or Legacy mode. When CME=1, the CHERI execution mode is Capability. When CME=0,
the mode is Legacy.

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether U-mode can perform
explicit accesses to CHERI registers.  When CRE=1, CHERI registers can be read
and written by U-mode.  When CRE=0, CHERI registers are in U-mode disabled as
described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].  CRE is read-only
zero if <<menvcfg>>.CRE=0.

CME and CRE form part of a WARL field as shown in xref:xenvcfg-warl-field[xrefstyle=short].

[#ddc,reftext="ddc"]
==== Default Data Capability (ddc)

The <<ddc>> CSR is a read-write capability register implicitly used as an
operand to authorise all data memory accesses when the current CHERI mode is
Legacy. This register must be readable in any implementation. Its reset value
is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<ddc>> is a data pointer,
so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses.
