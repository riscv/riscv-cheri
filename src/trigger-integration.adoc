=== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} with Sdtrig

The Sdtrig extension is generally orthogonal to {cheri_base_ext_name}. However,
the priority of synchronous exceptions and where triggers fit is adjusted as
shown in xref:trigger-exception-priority[xrefstyle=short].

[[trigger-exception-priority]]
.Synchronous exception priority (including triggers) in decreasing priority order. Entries added in {cheri_base_ext_name} are in *bold*
