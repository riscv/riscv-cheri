== "{cheri_levels_ext_name}" Extension for Capability Levels

{cheri_levels_ext_name} is an extension to {cheri_base_ext_name} that adds support for associating a level with capabilities and limiting the flow of capabilities to specific memory region subsets.
This extension allows assigning a level to capabilities, which in conjunction with two new permissions allows enforcing invariants on capability propagation.
For example, this can be used to ensure that a callee can only write a copy of the passed-in argument capability to specific locations in memory (e.g. the callee's stack frame but not the heap).
It can also be used to avoid sharing of compartment-local data (such as pointers to a stack object) between compartments.

NOTE: This specification only defines the architectural mechanics of this feature, for further information on how this can be used by software please refer to cite:[cheri-v9-spec].

The number of supported capability levels is implementation-defined, but this specification currently only requires supporting two levels (_local_ and _global_).


=== Capability format changes
{cheri_levels_ext_name} adds a new `LVLBITS`-bit field to the <<section_cap_encoding,capability encoding>>, the _<<section_cap_level>>_.
It also adds two new permission fields, <<el_perm>> and <<sl_perm>>.

- For `MXLEN=64` <<section_cap_encoding,capability encoding>>, the AP field is widened by `LVLBITS+1` bits (i.e. 2 bits for `LVLBITS=1`)

NOTE: The <<cap_encoding_xlen64,`MXLEN=64` capability encoding>> diagram shows the layout for `LVLBITS=1`

- For `MXLEN=32` the capability's <<cap_encoding_xlen32,AP>> field is able to encode these permissions without increasing in size (provided that LVLBITS&#8804;2).

NOTE: {cheri_levels_ext_name} requires that LVLBITS&#8805;1 although LVLBITS>1 is considered an experimental enhancement of this extension.
See <<section_ext_cheri_multiple_levels>> for the mechanics when LVLBITS>1.

[#section_cap_level,reftext="capability level"]
==== Capability Level (CL)

The Capability Level (CL) is a new field added to the capability encoding, as shown in xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short].

With `LVLBITS=1`, the _Capability Level_ can hold two values: when set to 1 the capability is _global_ (in general allowing it to be stored using any authorizing capability), and when set to 0 the capability is _local_, and can only be stored by authorizing capabilities with the <<sl_perm>> set.
Furthermore, the <<el_perm>> can be used to restrict loading of _global_ capabilities -- causing the hardware to automatically set the level of loaded capabilities to _local_ instead.

NOTE: The current specification only defines two levels, equivalent to _local_ and _global_ capabilities from CHERI v9, Morello and CHERIoT.

As with permissions, the capability level can only be decreased but never increased (without deriving from a capability with a higher level).
Therefore, the capability level is adjusted using the <<ACPERM>> instruction (see <<section_cap_level_change>>) and are queried using <<GCPERM>>.

==== New capability permissions
{cheri_levels_ext_name} introduces two new capability permissions:
[#sl_perm,reftext="SL-permission"]
Store Level Permission (SL):: This is a `LVLBITS` wide field that allows limiting the propagation of capabilities using the following logic: capabilities with a <<section_cap_level>> less than the inverse of the authorizing capability's <<sl_perm>> will be stored with the tag cleared.
With `LVLBITS=1` there is a single bit comparison, so it behaves as follows:
- If this field (as well as <<c_perm>> and <<w_perm>>) is set to 1 then capabilities may be stored via this capability regardless of their associated <<section_cap_level>>.
- If this field is zero, then any capability with a <<section_cap_level>> of zero (i.e. _local_), will be stored with the tag cleared.

NOTE: For `LVLBITS=1` this permission is equivalent to _StoreLocal_ in CHERI v9, Morello and CHERIoT.

[#el_perm,reftext="EL-permission"]
Elevate Level Permission (EL):: Any capability with its tag set to 1 that is loaded from memory has its <<el_perm>> cleared and its <<section_cap_level>> restricted to the authorizing capability's <<section_cap_level>> if the authorizing capability does not grant <<el_perm>>.
This permission is similar to the existing <<lm_perm>>, but instead of applying to the <<w_perm>> on the loaded capability it restricts the <<section_cap_level,CL>> field.



ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* This permission does not exist in CHERI v9, but is similar to CHERIoT's _LoadGlobal_ permission, except that any _global_ capability implicitly grants _LoadGlobal_.

[#section_cap_level_change]
=== Changing capability levels and permissions
While capability levels (<<section_cap_level,CL>>) are conceptually a label on the capability rather than a permission granted by the capability, they are adjusted using the <<ACPERM>> instruction.
This avoids the need for a dedicated instruction and allows reducing the level and removing <<el_perm>> in a single instruction.

[#section_ext_cheri_multiple_levels]
=== Extending {cheri_levels_ext_name} to more than two levels
When `LVLBITS>1`, the behaviour of <<ACPERM>> can no longer use masking to adjust the <<section_cap_level>> or <<sl_perm>>, but instead must perform an integer minimum operation on those `LVLBITS`-wide fields.
The <<section_cap_level,CL>> field of the resulting capability is set to `min(rs2[CL], cs1[CL])`  (equivalent to `rs2[CL] & cs1[CL]` for `LVLBITS=1`).
Similarly, <<sl_perm>> is set to `min(rs2[SL], cs1[SL])` (equivalent to `rs2[SL] & cs1[SL]` for `LVLBITS=1`).

When storing capabilities, the <<sl_perm>> checks need to perform a `LVLBITS`-wide integer comparison instead of just testing a single bit.
Considering for an example `LVLBITS=2`:

[options=header,grid=rows,cols="2,3,6"]
|===
|<<sl_perm>> | Permitted for levels| Resulting semantics
|3 | As low as `~0b11=0` | Authorizes stores of capabilities with any level
|2 | As low as `~0b10=1` | Strip tag for level 0 (most _local_), keep for 1,2,3
|1 | As low as `~0b01=2` | Strip tag for level 0&1, keep for 2&3
|0 | As low as `~0b00=3` | Strip tag for level 0,1,2, i.e. only the most _global_ can be stored
|===

NOTE: While this extra negation is non-intuitive, it is required such that <<ACPERM>> can use a monotonically decreasing operation for both <<section_cap_level,CL>> <<sl_perm>>.

NOTE: The layout of the <<ACPERM>> input / <<GCPERM>> result is not yet defined, but existing bits will not be moved around so the <<sl_perm,SL>>/<<section_cap_level,CL>> fields will be non-contiguous.
