== RISC-V Instructions and Extensions Reference

These instruction pages are for the new CHERI instructions, and some existing RISC-V
instructions where the effect of CHERI needs specific details.

For existing RISC-V instructions, note that:

. In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], every byte of each memory access is bounds
checked against <<ddc>>
. In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], a minimum length instruction at the target of all indirect
jumps is bounds checked against <<pcc>>
. In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] a minimum length instruction at the target of all indirect
jumps is bounds checked against `cs1` (e.g. <<JALR>>)
. A minimum length instruction at the taken target of all direct
jumps and conditional branches is bounds checked against <<pcc>> regardless of
CHERI execution mode

NOTE: Not all RISC-V extensions have been checked against CHERI. Compatible
extensions will eventually be listed in a CHERI profile.

[#Zcmt,reftext="Zcmt"]
=== "Zcmt" Standard Extension For Code-Size Reduction

The table jump instructions (<<CM.JT>>, <<CM.JALT>>) defined in cite:[riscv-code-size-spec] are _not_ redefined in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] to have capabilities in the jump table. This is to prevent the code-size growth caused by doubling the size of the jump table.

In the future, new jump table modes or new encodings can be added to have capabilities in the jump table.

The jump vector table CSR <<jvt>> has a capability alias <<jvtc>> so that it can only be configured to point to accessible memory. All accesses to the jump table are checked against <<jvtc>> in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}], and against <<pcc>> bounds in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}]. This allows the jump table to be accessed
when the <<pcc>> bounds are set narrowly to the local function only in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}].

NOTE: Zcmt defines that the fetch from the jump table is from instruction memory.
 The overall instruction executed is effectively 48-bit, with 16-bits from <<CM.JALT>>/<<CM.JT>>, the other 32-bits (for RV32) from the table.
 Therefore <<pcc>> is used to authorise the fetch in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}], as the fetch is designated to be from instruction memory in cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec].

NOTE: In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}] the implementation doesn't need to expand and bounds check against <<jvtc>> on every access, it is sufficient to decode the valid accessible range of entries after every write to <<jvtc>>, and then check that the accessed entry is in that range.

[#jvt,reftext="jvt"]
==== Jump Vector Table CSR (jvt)

The JVT CSR is exactly as defined by cite:[riscv-code-size-spec]. It is renamed to <<jvtc>>.

[#jvtc,reftext="jvtc"]
==== Jump Vector Table CSR (jvtc)

<<jvtc>> extends <<jvt>> to be a capability width CSR, as shown in xref:ucsrnames-renamed[xrefstyle=short].

.Jump Vector Table Capability register
include::img/jvtcreg.edn[]

All instruction fetches from the jump vector table are checked against <<jvtc>> in pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_cap_mode_name}].
In pass:attributes,quotes[{cheri_int_mode_name}] the address field gives the base address of the table, and the access is
checked against <<pcc>> bounds.

See <<CM_JALT>>, <<CM_JT>>.

If the access to the jump table succeeds, then the instructions execute as follows:

** <<CM_JT>> executes as <<J>> or <<AUIPC>>+<<JR>>
** <<CM_JALT>> executes as <<JAL>> or <<AUIPC>>+<<JALR>>

As a result the capability metadata is retained in <<pcc>> during execution.
