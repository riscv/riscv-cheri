== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} with the Hypervisor Extension

The RISC-V hypervisor (H) extension virtualizes the supervisor-level
architecture to support the efficient hosting of guest operating systems atop a
type-1 or type-2 hypervisor cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. The hypervisor extension is
generally orthogonal to CHERI; the main requirements, when integrating with
{cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name}, is that address CSRs added
for hypervisors are extended to CLEN size so that they are able to hold
capabilities. The remainder of this chapter describes these changes in detail.

[#hstatus,reftext="hstatus"]
=== Hypervisor Status Register (hstatus)

The <<hstatus>> register operates as described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] except
for the VSXL field that controls the value of XLEN for VS-mode (known as
VSXLEN).

The encoding of the VSXL field is the same as the MXL field of **misa**. Only 1
and 2 are supported values for VSXL. When the implementation supports
{cheri_base_ext_name} (but not {cheri_default_ext_name}), then <<hstatus>>'s
VSXL must be read-only as described in xref:mstatus[xrefstyle=short] for
<<mstatus>>.SXL. When the implementation supports both {cheri_base_ext_name}
and {cheri_default_ext_name}, then VSXL behaves as described in
xref:mstatus_hybrid[xrefstyle=short] for mstatus.SXL.

The VSBE field determines controls the endianness of explicit memory accesses
from VS-mode and implicit memory accesses to VS-level memory management data
structures. VSBE=0 indicates little endian and VSBE=1 is big endian. VSBE must
be read-only and equal to MBE when the implementation only supports
{cheri_base_ext_name}. VSBE is optionally writeable when
{cheri_default_ext_name} is also supported.

[#henvcfg,reftext="henvcfg"]
=== Hypervisor Environment Configuration Register (henvcfg)

The <<henvcfg>> register operates as described in the RISC-V Privileged
Specification. A new enable bit is added to <<henvcfg>> when the implementation
supports {cheri_default_ext_name} as shown in xref:henvcfgreg[xrefstyle=short].

.Hypervisor environment configuration register (*henvcfg*)
[#henvcfgreg]
include::img/henvcfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether explicit access to CHERI
registers is permitted when V=1. When <<henvcfg>>.CRE=1 and <<menvcfg>>.CRE=1
and <<mseccfg>>.CRE=1, CHERI registers can be read and written by VS-mode and
VU-mode. When <<henvcfg>>.CRE=0, CHERI registers are disabled in VS-mode and
VU-mode as described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].

The reset value is 0.

[#htval,reftext="htval"]
=== Hypervisor Trap Value Register (htval)

The <<htval>> register operates as described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec].
Additionally, <<htval>> may be written with the exception codes described in
xref:mtval[xrefstyle=short] when a CHERI exception occurs.

include::img/htvalreg.edn[]

[#vsstatus,reftext="vsstatus"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Status Register (vsstatus)

The <<vsstatus>> register operates as described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]
except for the UXL field that controls the value of XLEN for VU-mode.

The encoding of the UXL field is the same as the MXL field of **misa**. Only 1
and 2 are supported values for UXL. When the implementation supports
{cheri_base_ext_name} (but not {cheri_default_ext_name}), then <<vsstatus>>.UXL
must be read-only as described in xref:mstatus[xrefstyle=short] for
<<mstatus>>.UXL. When the implementation supports both {cheri_base_ext_name}
and {cheri_default_ext_name}, then UXL behaves as described in
xref:mstatus_hybrid[xrefstyle=short] for mstatus.UXL.

[#vstvec,reftext="vstvec"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Vector Base Address Register (vstvec)

The <<vstvec>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is
the VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is the VS mode's version of the
supervisor register <<stvec>>.

.Virtual supervisor trap vector base address register
include::img/vstvecreg.edn[]

[#vstvecc,reftext="vstvecc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Vector Base Address Capability Register (vstvecc)

The <<vstvecc>> register is a renamed extension of <<vstvec>> that is able to
hold a capability. Its reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

.Virtual supervisor trap vector base address capability register
include::img/vstveccreg.edn[]

The handling of <<vstvecc>> is otherwise identical to <<mtvecc>>, but in
virtual supervisor mode.

[#vsscratch,reftext="vsscratch"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Scratch Register (vsscratch)

The <<vsscratch>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is a
VSXLEN read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register
<<sscratch>>. <<vsscratch>> is extended into <<vsscratchc>>.

.Virtual supervisor scratch register
include::img/vsscratchreg.edn[]

[#vsscratchc,reftext="vsscratchc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Scratch Register (vsscratchc)

The <<vsscratchc>> register is a renamed version of <<vsscratch>> that is able
to hold a capability.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

It is not WARL, all capability fields must be implemented.

.Virtual supervisor scratch capability register
include::img/vsscratchcreg.edn[]

[#vsepc,reftext="vsepc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Exception Program Counter (vsepc)

The <<vsepc>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is extended
into <<vsepcc>>.

.Virtual supervisor exception program counter
include::img/vsepcreg.edn[]

[#vsepcc,reftext="vsepcc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Exception Program Counter Capability (vsepcc)

The <<vsepcc>> register is a renamed extension of <<vsepc>> that is able to
hold a capability. Its reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<vsepcc>> is an executable
vector, so it need not be able to hold all possible invalid addresses.
Additionally, the capability in <<vsepcc>> is unsealed when it is installed in
<<pcc>> on execute of an <<SRET>> instruction. The handling of <<vsepcc>> is
otherwise identical to <<mepcc>>, but in virtual supervisor mode.

include::img/vsepccreg.edn[]

[#vscause,reftext="vscause"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Cause Register (vscause)

The <<vscause>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It must
additionally support the new exception code for CHERI exceptions that
<<scause>> supports.

[#vstdc,reftext="vstdc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Default Capability Register (vstdc)

The <<vstdc>> register is a capability width read/write register that is
VS-mode's version of supervisor register <<stdc>>. This register is only
present when the implementation supports {cheri_default_ext_name}.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

{REQUIRE_CRE_CSR}

=== Existing Hypervisor Load and Store Instructions

The hypervisor extension defines several integer load and store instructions
(such as <<HLV_W>>, <<HSV_W>> and <<HLVX_WU>>) that transfer the amount of integer data
described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] between the registers and memory as though
V=1. These instructions change behaviour depending on the CHERI execution mode
although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

When in {cheri_cap_mode_name}, the hypervisor load and
store instructions behave as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short]. In
{cheri_int_mode_name}, the instructions behave as
described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] and rely on an *x* register operand
providing the effective address for the memory access; the capability
authorising the memory access is <<ddc>>.

The exception cases remain as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] regardless of the CHERI
execution mode.

=== Hypervisor Load and Store Capability Instructions

Hypervisor virtual-machine load (<<HLV.C>>) and store (<<HSV.C>>) capability
instructions read or write CLEN bits from memory as though V=1. These
instructions change behaviour depending on the CHERI execution mode although
the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

When in {cheri_cap_mode_name}, the hypervisor
load and store capability instructions behave as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short]. In
{cheri_int_mode_name}, the instructions behave as rely
on an *x* register operand providing the effective address for the memory
access and the capability authorising the memory access is <<ddc>>.
