[#section_cap_description]
== Anatomy of Capabilities in Zcheripurecap

RISC-V defines variants of the base integer instruction set characterized by
the width of the integer registers and the corresponding size of the address
space. There are two primary ISA variants, RV32I and RV64I, which provide
32-bit and 64-bit address spaces respectively. The term XLEN refers to the
width of an integer register in bits (either 32 or 64). The value of XLEN may
change dynamically at run-time depending on the values written to CSRs, so we
define capability behavior in terms of MXLEN, which is the value of XLEN used
in machine mode and the widest XLEN the implementation supports.

NOTE: {cheri_base_ext_name} assumes a version of the privileged architecture
which defines MXLEN as constant and requires higher privilege modes to have at
least the same XLEN as lower privilege modes; these changes are present in the
current draft and expected to be part of privileged architecture 1.13.

{cheri_base_ext_name} defines capabilities of size CLEN corresponding to 2 *
MXLEN without including the tag bit. The value of CLEN is always calculated
based on MXLEN regardless of the effective XLEN value.

[#section_cap_encoding]
=== Capability Encoding

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The encoding changes eliminate the concept of the
in-memory format, and also increase precision for RV32.
endif::[]

The components of a capability, except the tag, are encoded as shown in
xref:cap_encoding_xlen32[xrefstyle=short] for MXLEN=32 and
xref:cap_encoding_xlen64[xrefstyle=short] for MXLEN=64. Each memory location
or register able to hold a capability must also store the tag as out of band
information that software cannot directly set or clear. The capability metadata
is held in the most significant bits and the address is held in the least
significant bits.

.Capability encoding for MXLEN=64
[#cap_encoding_xlen64]
include::img/cap-encoding-xlen64.edn[]

Reserved bits are available for future extensions to {cheri_base_ext_name}.

NOTE: Reserved bits must be 0 in tagged capabilities.

=== Components of a Capability

Capabilities contain the software accessible fields described in this section.

[#section_tag]
==== Tag

The tag is an additional hardware managed bit added to addressable memory and
registers. It is stored separately and may be referred to as "out of band". It
indicates whether a register or CLEN-aligned memory location contains a valid
capability. If the tag is set, the capability is valid and can be dereferenced
(contingent on checks such as permissions or bounds).

The capability is invalid if the tag is clear. Using an invalid capability to
dereference memory or authorize any operation gives rise to exceptions. All
capabilities derived from invalid capabilities are themselves invalid i.e.
their tags are 0.

All locations in registers or memory able to hold a capability are CLEN+1 bits
wide including the tag bit. Those locations are referred as being _CLEN-bit_ or
_capability_ wide in this specification.

==== Address

The byte-address of a memory location is encoded as MXLEN integer value.

[#section_cap_perms]
==== Architectural Permissions (AP)

===== Description

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
WARNING: *CHERI v9 Note:* The permissions are encoded differently in this
specification.
endif::[]

This field encodes architecturally defined permissions of the capability.
Permissions grant access subject to the tag being set, the capability being
unsealed (see xref:section_cap_sealed[xrefstyle=short]), and bounds checks (see
xref:section_cap_bounds[xrefstyle=short]). An operation is also contingent on
requirements imposed by other RISC-V architectural features, such as virtual
memory, PMP and PMAs, even if the capability grants sufficient permissions. The
permissions currently defined in {cheri_base_ext_name} are listed
below.

[#r_perm,reftext="R-permission"]
Read Permission \(R):: Allow reading integer data from memory. Tags are always
read as zero when reading integer data.

[#w_perm,reftext="W-permission"]
Write Permission (W):: Allow writing integer data to memory. Tags are always
written as zero when writing integer data. Every CLEN aligned word in memory
has a tag, if any byte is overwritten with integer data then the tag for all
CLEN-bits is cleared.

[#c_perm,reftext="C-permission"]
Capability Permission \(C):: Allow reading capability data from memory if the
authorising capability also grants <<r_perm>>. Allow writing capability data to
memory if the authorising capability also grants <<w_perm>>.

[#x_perm,reftext="X-permission"]
Execute Permission (X):: Allow instruction execution.

[#asr_perm,reftext="ASR-permission"]
Access System Registers Permission (ASR):: Allow read and write access to all
privileged (M-mode and S-mode) CSRs with the following exceptions:
. <<utid>>, <<utidc>>, <<stid>>, <<stidc>>, <<mtid>>, <<mtidc>> all require ASR
access for writing and not for reading, as well as having a suitable privileged
execution mode.

[#cap_permissions_encoding]
===== Permission Encoding

The bit width of the permissions field depends on the value of MXLEN as shown
in xref:perms_bit_width[xrefstyle=short]. A {cap_rv32_perms_width}-bit vector
encodes the permissions when MXLEN=32. For this case, the legal encodings of
permissions are listed in xref:cap_perms_encoding32[xrefstyle=short]. Certain
combinations of permissions are impractical. For example, <<c_perm>> is
superfluous when the capability does not grant either <<r_perm>> or <<w_perm>>.
Therefore, it is only possible to encode a subset of all combinations.

.Permissions widths depending on MXLEN
[#perms_bit_width,options=header,align="center",width="80%",cols="^13%,^27%,<60%"]
|==============================================================================
^| MXLEN | AP field width         | Comment

^| 64    | {cap_rv64_perms_width} | Separate bits for each architectural permission.
|==============================================================================

For MXLEN=32, the permissions encoding is split into four quadrants.
The quadrant is taken from bits [4:3] of the permissions encoding.
The meaning for bits [2:0] are shown in <<cap_perms_encoding32>> for each quadrant.

Quadrants 2 and 3 are arranged to implicitly grant future permissions which may be added with the existing allocated encodings.
Quadrant 0 does the opposite - the encodings are allocated _not_ to implicitly add future permissions, and so granting future permissions will require new encodings.
Quadrant 1 encodes permissions for executable capabilities and the <<m_bit>>.

|==============================================================================

^1^ _Mode (<<m_bit>>) can only be set on a tagged capability when {cheri_default_ext_name}
is supported. Despite being encoded here it is *not* an architectural permission._

NOTE: When MXLEN=32 there are many reserved permission encodings (see
xref:cap_perms_encoding32[xrefstyle=short]). It is not possible for a tagged
capability to have one of these values since <<ACPERM>> will never create it. It is
possible for untagged capabilities to have reserved values. <<GCPERM>> will interpret
reserved values as if it were 0b00000 (no permissions). Future extensions may assign
meanings to the reserved bit patterns, in which case <<GCPERM>> is allowed to report a
non-zero value.

A {cap_rv64_perms_width}-bit vector encodes the permissions when MXLEN=64. In
this case, there is a bit per permission as shown in
xref:cap_perms_encoding64[xrefstyle=short]. A permission is granted if its
corresponding bit is set, otherwise the capability does not grant that
permission.

<<<

| 2   | <<r_perm>>
| 3   | <<x_perm>>
| 4   | <<asr_perm>>
//| 5   | <<m_bit>>
|==============================================================================

The <<m_bit>> is only assigned meaning when the
implementation supports {cheri_default_ext_name} _and_ <<x_perm>> is set.

. For MXLEN=64, the bit assigned to the <<m_bit>> must be zero if <<x_perm>> isn't set.
. For MXLEN=32, the <<m_bit>> is only encoded in quadrant 1 and does _not_ exist in the other quadrants.

===== Permission Transitions

Executing <<ACPERM>> can result in sets of permissions which cannot be represented when MXLEN=32
(see <<cap_perms_encoding32>>) or permission combinations which are not useful for MXLEN=64, such as
<<asr_perm>> set without <<x_perm>>.

These cases are defined to return useful minimal sets of permissions, which may be no permissions. See
<<ACPERM>> for these rules.

NOTE: Future extensions may allow more combinations of permissions, especially for MXLEN=64.

[#sdp,reftext="SDP"]
==== Software-Defined Permissions (SDP)

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* CHERI v9 had no software-defined permissions for RV32
endif::[]

A bit vector used by the kernel or application programs for software-defined
permissions (SDP).

NOTE: Software is completely free to define the usage of these bits. For
example, a program may decide to use an SDP bit to indicate the "ownership" of
objects. Therefore, a capability grants permission to free the memory it
references if that SDP bit is set because it "owns" that object.

[#section_cap_sealed]
==== Sealed (S) Bit

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
WARNING: *CHERI v9:* The sealing bit is new (1-bit otype) and the old CHERI v9
otype no longer exists. Please note that this bit indicates the result of
two instructions in CHERI v9: CSEAL for sealed capabilities and
CSEALENTRY for sealed entry capabilities.
endif::[]

This bit indicates that a capability is sealed if the bit is 1 or unsealed if it is 0.

The sealing bit conflates two concepts in one bit: Sealing data capabilities and
creating sealed entry capabilities as described below.

Sealed capabilities cannot be dereferenced to access memory and are immutable
such that modifying any of its fields clears the tag of the output capability.

NOTE: Sealed capabilities might be useful to software as tokens that can be passed
around. The only way of removing the seal bit of a capability is by rebuilding
it via a superset capability with <<CBLD>>. {cheri_base_ext_name} does not offer
an unseal instruction.

For code capabilities, the sealing bit is used to implement immutable
capabilities that describe function entry points, known as sealed entry (sentry) capabilities. Such capabilities can be leveraged
to establish a form of control-flow integrity between mutually distrusting code. A program may jump to a
sentry capability to begin executing the instructions it references. A <<JALR>>
instruction with zero offset automatically unseals a sentry target capability and installs it in the
program counter capability (see
xref:section_riscv_programmers_model[xrefstyle=short]). The jump-and-link instructions
also seal the return address capability which serves as an entry point the callee can return to but cannot use to authorize memory loads or stores.

[#section_cap_bounds]
==== Bounds (EF, T, TE, B, BE)

===== Concept

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The bounds mantissa width is different in MXLEN=32.
Also, the old IE bit is renamed to Exponent Format (EF); the function of IE
is the inverse of EF i.e. IE=0 has the same effect as EF=1.

NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The mantissa width for RV32 was increased to 10.

NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The sense of the exponent is reversed, so an encoded
value of 0 represents CAP_MAX_E, and CAP_MAX_E represents 0 from the previous
specification.
endif::[]

The bounds encode the base and top addresses that constrain memory accesses.
The capability can be used to access any memory location A in the range base
&#8804; A < top. The bounds are encoded in compressed format, so it is not
possible to encode any arbitrary combination of base and top addresses. An
invalid capability with tag cleared is produced when attempting to construct a
capability that is not _representable_ because its bounds cannot be correctly
encoded. The bounds are decoded as described in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short].

The bounds field has the following components:

* *T:* Value substituted into the capability's address to decode the top
address
* *B:* Value substituted into the capability's address to decode the base
address
* *E:* Exponent that determines the position at which B and T are substituted
into the capability's address
* *EF:* Exponent format flag indicating the encoding for T, B and E
    ** The exponent is stored in T and B if EF=0, so it is 'internal'
    ** The exponent is zero if EF=1

The bit width of T and B are defined in terms of the mantissa width (MW) which
is set depending on the value of MXLEN as shown in
xref:mantissa_bit_width[xrefstyle=short].

The exponent E indicates the position of T and B within the capability's
address as described in xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short]. The bit
width of the exponent (EW) is set depending on the value of MXLEN. The
maximum value of the exponent is calculated as follows:

```
CAP_MAX_E = MXLEN - MW + 2
```

The possible values for EW and CAP_MAX_E are shown in
xref:exp_bit_width[xrefstyle=short].

NOTE: The address and bounds must be representable in valid capabilities i.e.
when the tag is set (see xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]).

[#section_cap_bounds_decoding]
===== Decoding

The metadata is encoded in a compressed format cite:[woodruff2019cheri]. It
uses a floating point representation to encode the bounds relative to the
capability address. The base and top addresses from the bounds are decoded as
shown below.

WARNING: #TODO: The pseudo-code below does not have a formal notation. It is
simply a place-holder while the Sail implementation is unavailable. In this
notation, / means "integer division", [] are the bit-select operators, and
arithmetic is signed.#

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The IE bit from CHERI v9 is renamed EF and its value is
inverted to ensure that the <<null-cap>> capability is encoded as zero without the
need for CHERI v9's in-memory format. +
When EF=1, the exponent E=0, so the address bits a[MW - 1:0] are replaced
with T and B to form the top and base addresses respectively. +
When EF=0, the exponent `E=CAP_MAX_E - ( (MXLEN == 32) ? { L8, TE, BE } : { TE, BE } )`,
so the address bits a[E + MW - 1:E] are replaced with T and B to form the top
and base addresses respectively. E is computed by subtracting from the maximum
possible exponent CAP_MAX_E which can be efficiently implemented in hardware
assuming that T and B are at bit CAP_MAX_E and performing a logical bitwise
shift right by E. In contrast, CHERI v9 implementations computed the top and
base addresses by assuming that T and B are at bit 0 and performing a logical
bitwise shift left by E.
endif::[]

```
EW        = (MXLEN == 32) ? 5 : 6
CAP_MAX_E = MXLEN - MW + 2

If EF = 1:
    E               = 0
    T[EW / 2 - 1:0] = TE
    B[EW / 2 - 1:0] = BE
    LCout           = (T[MW - 3:0] < B[MW - 3:0]) ? 1 : 0
    LMSB            = (MXLEN == 32) ? L8 : 0
else:
    E               = CAP_MAX_E - ( (MXLEN == 32) ? { L8, TE, BE } : { TE, BE } )

    LMSB            = 1
```

Reconstituting the top two bits of T:

```
T[MW - 1:MW - 2] = B[MW - 1:MW - 2] + LCout + LMSB
```

Decoding the bounds:

```
top:    t = { a[MXLEN - 1:E + MW] + ct, T[MW - 1:0]    , {E{1'b0}} }
base:   b = { a[MXLEN - 1:E + MW] + cb, B[MW - 1:0]    , {E{1'b0}} }
```
The corrections c~t~ and c~b~ are calculated as as shown below using the
definitions in xref:cap_encoding_ct[xrefstyle=short] and
xref:cap_encoding_cb[xrefstyle=short].

|==============================================================================

The base, _b_, and top, _t_, addresses are derived from the address by
substituting _a_[E + MW - 1:E] with B and T respectively and clearing the
lower E bits.  The most significant bits of _a_ may be adjusted up or down by 1
using corrections _c~b~_ and _c~t~_ to allow encoding memory regions that span
alignment boundaries.

The EF bit selects between two cases:

1. EF = 1: The exponent is 0 for regions less than 2^MW-2^ bytes long. L~8~ is
used to encode the MSB of the length and is added to B along with T[MW-3:0] to
form the decoded top.
2. EF = 0: The exponent is _internal_ with E stored in the lower bits of T and
B along with L~8~ when MXLEN=32. E is chosen so that the most significant
non-zero bit of the length of the region aligns with T[MW - 2] in the decoded
top. Therefore, the most significant two bits of T can be derived from B using
the equality `T = B + L`, where L[MW - 2] is known from the values of EF and E
and a carry out is implied if `T[MW - 3:0] < B[MW - 3:0]` since it is
guaranteed that the top is larger than the base.

The compressed bounds encoding allows the address to roam over a large
_representable_ region while maintaining the original bounds. This is enabled by
defining a lower boundary R from the out-of-bounds values that allows us to
disambiguate the location of the bounds with respect to an out-of-bounds address.
R is calculated
relative to the base by subtracting 2^MW-2^ from B.
If B, T or _a_[E + MW - 1:E] is less than R, it is inferred that they lie in the
2^E+MW^ aligned region above R labelled space~U~ in
xref:cap_bounds_map[xrefstyle=short] and the corrections _c~t~_ and _c~b~_ are
computed accordingly. The overall effect is that the address can roam
2^E+MW^/4 bytes below
the base address and at least 2^E+MW^/4 bytes above the top address
while still allowing the bounds to be correctly decoded.

[#cap_bounds_map]
.Memory address bounds encoded within a capability
image::cap-bounds-map.png[width=80%,align=center]

A capability has _infinite_ bounds if its bounds cover the entire address space
such that the base address _b_=0 and the top address _t_&#8805;2^MXLEN^,
i.e. _t_ is an MXLEN + 1 bit value. However, _b_ is an
MXLEN bit value and the size mismatch introduces additional complications
when decoding, so the following condition is required to correct _t_ for
capabilities whose <<section_cap_representable_check>> wraps the edge of the address
space:

```
if ( (E < (CAP_MAX_E - 1)) & (t[MXLEN: MXLEN - 1] - b[MXLEN - 1] > 1) )
    t[MXLEN] = !t[MXLEN]
```
That is, invert the most significant bit of _t_ if the decoded length of the
capability is larger than E.

NOTE: A capability has infinite bounds if E=CAP_MAX_E and it is not
malformed (see xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]); this check is
equivalent to _b_=0 and _t_&#8805;2^MXLEN^.

[#section_cap_malformed]
===== Malformed Capability Bounds

A capability is _malformed_ if its encoding does not describe a valid
capability because its bounds cannot be correctly decoded. The following check
indicates whether a capability is malformed. `enableL8` is true when MXLEN=32
and false otherwise, indicating whether the `L8` bit is available for extra
precision when `EF=1`.

```
malformedMSB =  (E == CAP_MAX_E     && B         != 0)
             || (E == CAP_MAX_E - 1 && B[MW - 1] != 0)
malformedLSB =  (E  < 0) || (E == 0 && enableL8)
malformed    =  !EF && (malformedMSB || malformedLSB)
```

NOTE: The check is for malformed _bounds_, so it does not include reserved
bits!

It is impossible for a CHERI core to generate a tagged capability with malformed
bounds, or with any reserved bits set. If such a capability exists then it must
have been caused by a logic or memory fault.

Capabilities with malformed bounds:

. Return both base and top bounds as zero, which affects instructions like <<GCBASE>>.
. Cause certain manipulation instructions like <<CADDI>> to always clear the tag of the result.

See specific instruction pages for full details of the effect of malformed capabilities.

The <<null-cap>> capability is represented with 0 in all fields. This implies
that it has no permissions and its exponent E is CAP_MAX_E (52 for MXLEN=64,
24 for MXLEN=32), so its bounds cover the entire address space such that the
expanded base is 0 and top is 2^MXLEN^.

The <<infinite-cap>> capability grants all permissions while its bounds also

=== Representable Range Check

==== Concept

The new address, after updating the address of a capability, is within the
_representable range_ if decompressing the capability's bounds with the
original and new addresses yields the same base and top addresses.

In other words, given a capability with address _a_ and the
new address `a' = a + x`, the bounds _b_ and _t_ are decoded using _a_ and the
new bounds _b'_ and _t'_ are decoded using _a'_. The new address is within the
capability's _representable range_ if `b == b' && t == t'`.

Changing a capability's address to a value outside the _representable range_
unconditionally clears the capability's tag. Examples are:

* Instructions such as <<CADD>> which include pointer arithmetic.
* The <<SCADDR>> instruction which updates the capability address field.

==== Practical Information

In the bounds encoding in this specification, the top and bottom capability
bounds are formed of two or three sections:

* Upper bits from the address
** This is only if the other sections do not fill the available bits (E + MW &#8804; MXLEN)
* Middle bits from T and B decoded from the metadata
* Lower bits are set to zero
** This is only if there is an internal exponent (EF=0)

.Composition of the decoded top address bound
[#comp_addr_bounds,options=header,align="center",cols="2,4,2,2"]
|==============================================================================
| Configuration  | Upper Section (if E + MW &#8804; MXLEN) | Middle Section | Lower Section
| EF=0           | address[MXLEN:E + MW] + ct | T[MW - 1:0] | {E{1'b0}}
| EF=1, i.e. E=0 | address[MXLEN:MW] + ct   2+| T[MW - 1:0]
|==============================================================================

The top described by xref:comp_addr_bounds[xrefstyle=short] is MXLEN+1 bits
wide to allow capabilities to span the whole address space. The address is
zero-extended by one bit. The malformed check (see
xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]) ensures that the top never
overflows into MXLEN+2 bits and that the base never overflows into MXLEN+1
bits.

The _representable range_ defines the range of addresses which do not corrupt
the bounds encoding. The encoding was first introduced in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short], and is repeated in a different
form in xref:comp_addr_bounds[xrefstyle=short] to aid this description.

For the address to be valid for the current bounds encoding, the value
in the _Upper Section_ of xref:comp_addr_bounds[xrefstyle=short] _must
not change_ as this will change the meaning of the bounds.

This gives a range of `s=2^E+MW^`, as shown in
xref:cap_bounds_map[xrefstyle=short].

The gap between the object bounds and the bound of the representable range
is always guaranteed
to be at least 1/4 of `s`. This is represented by `R = B - 2^MW-2^` in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short].
This gives useful guarantees, such that if an executed instruction is in
<<pcc>> bounds, then it is also guaranteed that the next linear instruction
is _representable_.
