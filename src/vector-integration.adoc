== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} with the Vector Extension

The RISC-V vector (V) extension is orthogonal to CHERI because the
vector registers only hold integer or floating-point data. The vector registers
are _not_ extended to hold capabilities.

NOTE: A future extension may allow tags to be stored in vector registers.
  Until that time, vector load and store instructions must not be used to implement generic
  memory copying in software, such as the `memcpy()` standard C library function,
  because the vector registers do not hold capabilities, so the tags of any
  copied capabilities will be set to 0 in the destination memory.

Vector loads and stores all follow the behaviour as described in
xref:section_int_load_store_insns[xrefstyle=short].

The assembly syntax of all vector loads and stores are updated in
{cheri_cap_mode_name}, so that the address operand becomes a *c* operand instead
of an *x* operand.

According to the vector extension cite:[riscv-v-spec] only _active_ elements are
accessed or updated in memory. Therefore only _active_ elements are subject to
CHERI exception checks. If a vector load or store has no _active_ elements then
_no_ CHERI fault will be taken.

This is consistent with other exceptions such as page faults which are only taken
on _active_ elements.

In the case of fault-only-first loads, only the first element will cause a CHERI
length violation. If a later element causes a length violation, then it will be
treated the same way as a page fault and vl will be reduced.
All other CHERI exceptions, such as tag and permission violations are checked on
the first element, and so will be taken as expected.

NOTE: Indexed loads in {cheri_cap_mode_name} check the bounds of every access against
the authority capability in `cs1`. Therefore the approach of having a zero base
register and treating every element as an absolute address may not work well
in this mode.
