== Introduction

=== CHERI Concepts and Terminology

Current CPU architectures (including RISC-V) allow memory access solely by
specifying and dereferencing a memory address stored as an integer value in
a register or in memory. Any accidental or malicious action that modifies
such an integer value can result in unrestricted access to the memory that
it addresses. Unfortunately, this weak memory protection model has resulted
in the majority of software security vulnerabilities present in software
today.

CHERI enables software to efficiently implement fine-grained memory protection
and scalable software compartmentalization by providing strong, efficient
hardware mechanisms to support software execution and enable it to prevent
and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Design goals include incremental adoptability from current ISAs and software
stacks, low performance overhead for memory protection, significant performance
improvements for software compartmentalization, formal grounding, and
programmer-friendly underpinnings. It has been designed to provide strong,
non-probabilistic protection rather than depending on short random numbers or
truncated cryptographic hashes that can be leaked and reinjected, or that could
be brute forced.

CHERI enhances the CPU to add hardware memory access control. It has an
additional memory access mechanism that protects _references to code and data_
(pointers), rather than the _location of code and data_ (integer addresses).
This mechanism is implemented by providing a new primitive, called a
*capability*, that software components can use to implement strongly protected
pointers within an address space.

Capabilities are unforgeable and delegatable tokens of authority that grant
software the ability to perform a specific set of operations. In CHERI,
integer-based pointers can be replaced by capabilities to provide memory access
control. In this case, a memory access capability contains an integer memory
address that is extended with metadata to protect its integrity, limit how it
is manipulated, and control its use. This metadata includes:

*  an out-of-band _tag_ implementing strong integrity protection
(differentiating valid and invalid capabilities) that prevents confusion
between data and capabilities
* _bounds_ limiting the range of addresses that may be dereferenced
* _permissions_ controlling the specific operations that may be performed
* _sealing_ which is used to support higher-level software encapsulation

The CHERI model is motivated by the _principle of least privilege_, which
argues that greater security can be obtained by minimizing the privileges
accessible to running software. A second guiding principle is the _principle of
intentional use_, which argues that, where many privileges are available to a
piece of software, the privilege to use should be explicitly named rather than
implicitly selected. While CHERI does not prevent the expression of vulnerable
software designs, it provides strong vulnerability mitigation: attackers have a
more limited vocabulary for attacks, and should a vulnerability be successfully
exploited, they gain fewer rights, and have reduced access to further attack
surfaces.

Protection properties for capabilities include the ISA ensuring that
capabilities are always derived via valid manipulations of other capabilities
(_provenance_), that corrupted in-memory capabilities cannot be dereferenced
(_integrity_), and that rights associated with capabilities shall only ever be
equal or less permissive (_monotonicity_). Tampering or modifying capabilities
in an attempt to elevate their rights will yield an invalid capability as the
tag will be cleared. Attempting to dereference via an invalid capability
will result in a hardware exception.

CHERI capabilities may be held in registers or in memories, and are loaded,
stored, and dereferenced using CHERI-aware instructions that expect capability
operands rather than integer addresses. On hardware reset, initial capabilities
are made available to software via capability
registers. All other capabilities will be derived from these initial valid
capabilities through valid capability transformations.

Developers can use CHERI to build fine-grained spatial and temporal memory
protection into their system software and applications and significantly
improve their security.

=== CHERI Extensions to RISC-V

This specification is based on publicly available documentation including
cite:[cheri-v9-spec] and cite:[woodruff2019cheri]. It defines the following
extensions to support CHERI alongside RISC-V:

{cheri_base_ext_name}:: Introduces key, minimal CHERI concepts and features to
the RISC-V ISA. The resulting extended ISA is not
backwards-compatible with RISC-V.
{cheri_default_ext_name}:: Extends {cheri_base_ext_name} with features to ensure
that the ISA extended with CHERI allows backwards binary compatibility with
RISC-V.
It also adds a mode bit in the encoding of capabilities to
allow changing the current CHERI execution mode using indirect jump
instructions.
{cheri_pte_ext_name}:: CHERI extension for RISC-V harts supporting page-based
virtual-memory.
{cheri_vectorcap_ext_name}:: CHERI extension for the RISC-V Vector (V)
extension. It adds support for storing CHERI capabilities in
vector registers, intended for vectorised memory copying.
{tid_ext_name}:: Extension for supporting thread identifiers. This extension
improves software compartmentalization on CHERI systems.

CAUTION: The extension names are provisional and subject to change.

{cheri_base_ext_name} is defined as the base extension which all CHERI RISC-V
implementations must support. {cheri_default_ext_name}
and {cheri_pte_ext_name} are optional extensions in addition to
{cheri_base_ext_name}.

If a standard vector extension is present (indicated in this document as "V",
but it could equally be one of the subsets defined by a Zve* extension) then
{cheri_vectorcap_ext_name} may optionally be added in addition to
{cheri_base_ext_name}.

We refer to software as _purecap_ if it utilizes CHERI capabilities for all
memory accesses -- including loads, stores and instruction fetches -- rather
than integer addresses. Purecap software requires the CHERI RISC-V hart to
support {cheri_base_ext_name}. We refer to software as _Hybrid_ if it uses
integer addresses *or* CHERI capabilities for memory accesses. Hybrid software
requires the CHERI RISC-V hart to support {cheri_base_ext_name} and
{cheri_default_ext_name}.

See xref:riscv-extensions[xrefstyle=short] for compatibility with other RISC-V
extensions.

=== Risks and Known Uncertainty

* All extensions could be divided up differently in the future, including after
ratification
* The RISC-V Architecture Review Committee (ARC) are likely to update all
encodings
* The ARC are likely to update all CSR addresses
* Instruction mnemonics may be renamed
    ** Any changes will affect assembly code, but assembler aliases can provide
backwards compatibility
* There is no clarity on how the new Page Table Entry (PTE) bits from
{cheri_pte_ext_name} will be implemented
    ** The PTE bits introduce a dependency between exceptions and the stored
tag bit
* There is debate on whether different permission encodings are needed for
MXLEN=32 and MXLEN=64

==== Pending Extensions

The base RISC-V ISAs, along with most extensions, have been reviewed for
compatibility with CHERI. However, the following extensions are yet to be
reviewed:

* "V" Standard Extension for Vector Operations
* Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC)

CAUTION: The list above is not complete!

==== Incompatible Extensions

There are RISC-V extensions in development that may duplicate some aspects of
CHERI functionality or directly conflict with CHERI and should not be
available on a CHERI-enabled hart. These include:

* RISC-V CFI specification
* "J" Pointer Masking

CAUTION: The list above is not complete!
