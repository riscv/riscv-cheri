== "{cheri_seal_ext_name}" Extension for CHERI Capability (Un)Sealing

#Begin new since last ARC review#

IMPORTANT: {not_v1_ratification_package}

=== Explicit Sealing and Unsealing Operations

The {cheri_base_ext_name} base architecture defines <<sealed_cap>>s.
The <<CBLD>>, <<JALR_CHERI>>, and <<YSUNSEAL>> instruction
and the <<section_rvy_sentry_insn_ext>> extension
allow platforms to build and consume sealed capabilities in
particular ways.
This extension introduces a more general,
intentional (that is, capability-mediated) mechanism for
introduction and elimination of sealed capability forms,
in keeping with CHERI's _principle of intentional use_.

This extension first introduces a fundamentally new _kind_ of capabilities,
"**type** capabilities",
whose address space and borne authority ranges not over _memory_
but rather <<sec_cap_type>>-s.
As subsequently detailed, these capabilities, and their new permissions,
will serve as authorizing capabilities to new instructions
which perform transformations of other capabilities' <<sec_cap_type>> fields:

* Constructing a sealed capability with type `T` from an unsealed capability
  requires the authority to seal at type `T`, and

* Constructing an unsealed capability from a sealed capability with type `T`
  requires the authority to unseal at type `T`.

This extension does not define "type conversion" transformations
directly between sealed capability types.

=== Usable <<sec_cap_type>> Values Are Encoding Specified

The capabilities used to mediate (un)sealing are, like memory capabilities,
associated with an XLEN-bit address space.
However, capability encodings will have fewer than XLEN bits devoted to storing
<<sec_cap_type>> values.
As such, encodings will specify what <<sec_cap_type>> values can be used to seal
capabilities
(recall that encodings _must_ support representing unsealed capabilities).
The remainder of the address space described by type capabilities
is available for software use.

=== Single Address Space Encodings

Capability encodings are permitted to conflate memory and type address spaces,
such that one capability may authorize both memory access to a location and
(un)sealing with a type of equal numeric value.
Indeed, the encoding of <<app_cap_description>> is one such encoding.
Ideally, such encodings should permit separate manipulation of (un)sealing
permission and memory access permissions,
so that software can segregate the address spaces even when the encoding does
not intrinsically.

=== Added Architectural Permissions (AP) Bits

[#zyseal_ap_field,width="100%",options=header,halign=center,cols="2,2,5"]
|==============================================================================
| Permission         | Type                        | Comment
| <<zyseal_se_perm>> | <<sec_cap_type>> permission | Grants sealing authority
| <<zyseal_us_perm>> | <<sec_cap_type>> permission | Grants unsealing authority
|==============================================================================

[#zyseal_se_perm,reftext="SE-permission"]
Seal Permission (SE):: Permit the bearer to <<YSEAL>> capabilities
at the in-bound types of this capability.

[#zyseal_us_perm,reftext="US-permission"]
Unseal Permission (US):: Permit the bearer to <<YUNSEAL>> capabilities
at the in-bound types of this capability.

=== Interaction with <<CLRPERM>> and <<GCPERM>>

.Extended capability permissions bit field (see <<acperm_bit_field>>)
[#zyseal_acperm_bit_field]
include::./img/zyseal-acperm_bit_field.edn[]

The <<zyseal_se_perm>> and <<zyseal_us_perm>> fields are mapped into
the <<acperm_bit_field,capability permissions bitfield>> (<<acperm_bit_field>>),
used by <<CLRPERM>> and <<GCPERM>>,
as shown in <<zyseal_acperm_bit_field>>.

=== Added Instructions

<<YSEAL>>:: A `{YSEAL_LC} {cd}, {cs1}, {cs2}` instruction will use the provided
sealing authority of `{cs1}` to copy the _unsealed_ capability
in `{cs2}` into `{cd}` and seal it with type `{cs1}.address`,
assuming `{cs1}` has a set tag, is in bounds, and grants <<zyseal_se_perm>>.

<<YUNSEAL>>:: A `{YUNSEAL_LC} {cd}, {cs1}, {cs2}` instruction will use the
provided unsealing authority of `{cs1}` to copy the sealed capability
in `{cs2}` into `{cd}` and unseal it,
so long as `{cs2}.ct = {cs1}.address`.
