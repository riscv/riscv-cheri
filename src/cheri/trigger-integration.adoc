[#section_debug_integration_trig]
=== "{cheri_priv_debug_trig}", Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} with Sdtrig

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
WARNING: This chapter will appear in the priv spec. Exact location TBD.
endif::[]

The Sdtrig extension is orthogonal to {cheri_base_ext_name}. However,
the priority of synchronous exceptions and where triggers fit is adjusted as
shown in xref:trigger-exception-priority[xrefstyle=short].

Debug triggers are higher priority than CHERI exceptions to allow debug.

[[trigger-exception-priority]]
.Synchronous exception priority (including triggers) in decreasing priority order. Entries added in {cheri_base_ext_name} are in *bold*
