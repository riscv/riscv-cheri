[#sh4add_ext]
== "Zish4add" Extension for 16-byte pointer addition, Version 0.9

WARNING: This chapter will appear in the unpriv spec (see https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/pull/1923).

The B-extension adds `SH[1|2|3]ADD` instructions, and for RV64 all have an unsigned word `*.UW` version.

Zish4add adds two new analogous instructions to RV64: SH4ADD and SH4ADD.UW.

{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0x33, attr: ['OP'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x7, attr: ['rv64: SH4ADD'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },
    { bits:  7, name: 16, attr: ['rv64: SH4ADD'] },
]}
....

Increment `rs2` by `rs1` shifted left by 4 bit positions and write the result to `rd`.

{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0x3b, attr: ['OP-32'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x7, attr: ['rv64: SH4ADD.UW'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },
    { bits:  7, name: 16, attr: ['rv64: SH4ADD.UW'] },
]}
....

Increment `rs2` by the unsigned word in `rs1` shifted left by 4 bit positions and write the result to `rd`.

If the base architecture is {cheri_base_ext_name}, and the CHERI execution mode is {cheri_cap_mode_name} then both of these instructions use <<SCADDR>> semantics to update the output register.
