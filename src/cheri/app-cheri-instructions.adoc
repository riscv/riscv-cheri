== RISC-V Instructions with different behavior for {cheri_base_ext_name}

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
WARNING: This chapter needs to be refactored. It will appear as an appendix in the unpriv specification.
endif::[]

These instruction pages are for the new CHERI instructions, and some existing RISC-V
instructions where the effect of CHERI needs specific details.

For existing RISC-V instructions, note that:

. In {cheri_int_mode_name}, every byte of each memory access is bounds checked against <<ddc>>

NOTE: Not all RISC-V extensions have been checked against CHERI. Compatible
extensions will eventually be listed in a CHERI profile.

One group of 16-bit encodings are remapped to different instructions dependent
upon the CHERI execution mode, MXLEN and which extensions are supported.

The double move instructions (<<CM_MVSA01_CHERI>>, <<CM_MVA01S_CHERI>>) are redefined in {cheri_cap_mode_name} to move capability data between registers. The saved register mapping is as shown in <<saved_register_mapping>>.

[#Zcmt_CHERI,reftext="Zcmt ({cheri_base32_ext_name})"]
=== "Zcmt" Standard Extension For Code-Size Reduction

The table jump instructions (<<CM_JT_CHERI>>, <<CM_JALT_CHERI>>) defined in cite:[riscv-code-size-spec] are _not_ redefined in {cheri_cap_mode_name} to have capabilities in the jump table. This is to prevent the code-size growth caused by doubling the size of the jump table.

In the future, new jump table modes or new encodings can be added to have capabilities in the jump table.

The jump vector table CSR <<jvt_cheri>> has a capability alias <<jvtc>> so that it can only be configured to point to accessible memory.
All accesses to the jump table are checked against <<jvtc>> in {cheri_cap_mode_name}, and against <<pcc>> bounds in {cheri_int_mode_name}.
This allows the jump table to be accessed when the <<pcc>> bounds are set narrowly to the local function only in {cheri_cap_mode_name}.

NOTE: In {cheri_cap_mode_name} the instruction fetch bounds check is authorized by two different capabilities - <<jvtc>> for the table access and <<pcc>> for the <<CM_JALT_CHERI>>/<<CM_JT_CHERI>> instruction, and target instruction.

NOTE: In {cheri_cap_mode_name} the implementation doesn't need to expand and bounds check against <<jvtc>> on every access, it is sufficient to decode the valid accessible range of entries after every write to <<jvtc>>, and then check that the accessed entry is in that range.

[#jvt_cheri,reftext="jvt ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== Jump Vector Table CSR (jvt) ({cheri_base_ext_name})

The JVT CSR is exactly as defined by cite:[riscv-code-size-spec]. It is extended to <<jvtc>>.

[#jvtc,reftext="jvtc"]
==== Jump Vector Table CSR (jvtc)

<<jvtc>> extends the Zcmt <<jvt_cheri>> CSR to be CLEN bits.

.Jump Vector Table Capability register
include::img/jvtcreg.edn[]

All instruction fetches from the jump vector table are checked against <<jvtc>> in {cheri_cap_mode_name}.
In {cheri_int_mode_name} the address field gives the base address of the table, and the access is checked against <<pcc>> bounds.

See <<CM_JALT_CHERI>>, <<CM_JT_CHERI>>.

If the access to the jump table succeeds, then the instructions execute as follows:

** <<CM_JT_CHERI>>   executes as <<JAL_CHERI,J>>   or <<AUIPC_CHERI,AUIPC>>+<<JALR_CHERI,JR>>
** <<CM_JALT_CHERI>> executes as <<JAL_CHERI,JAL>> or <<AUIPC_CHERI,AUIPC>>+<<JALR_CHERI,JALR>>

As a result the capability metadata is retained in <<pcc>> during execution.
