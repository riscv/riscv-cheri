== "Machine/Supervisor-Level ISA ({cheri_base_ext_name})" Extensions, Version 1.0

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
WARNING: This chapter will appear in the priv spec. Exact location TBD.
endif::[]

This chapter describes integration of {cheri_base_ext_name} with the RISC-V privileged architecture.

=== Machine-Level CSRs added or extended by {cheri_base_ext_name}

{cheri_base_ext_name} extends some M-mode CSRs to hold capabilities or
otherwise add new functions. <<asr_perm>> in the <<pcc>> is always required for access
to privileged CSRs.

[#mtvec_y,reftext="mtvec ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== Machine Trap Vector Base Address Capability Register (mtvec)

The <<mtvec>> register is extended to hold a code capability.
Its reset value is nominally a <<root-rx-cap>> capability.

NOTE: <<mtvec_y>> exists in all CHERI implementations, and so may be used as a source of a <<root-rx-cap>> capability after reset.

.Machine-mode trap-vector base-capability register
include::img/mtveccreg.edn[]

The fields in the metadata are WARL as many fields can be implemented as constants.

NOTE: Examples of WARL behavior include always setting <<x_perm>> to 1 and setting the reserved fields to zero, otherwise the capability is unusable.
 Another example is to partially or fully restrict the bounds to constant values.

NOTE: Care must be taken however that suitable root capabilities are available to software after reset if this CSR does not represent one.

When traps are taken into machine mode, the pc is updated following the standard `mtvec` behavior.
The {ctag} and metadata from <<mtvec_y>> are also written to the <<pcc>>.

Following the standard `mtvec` behavior, the value of `mtvec.address` can be viewed with a range of different addresses:

. The MODE field is included in `mtvec.address[1:0]` but it does not form part of the trap vector address.
. When MODE=Vectored, the trap vector address is incremented by four times the interrupt number.
. CSR reads include MODE in `mtvec.address[1:0]`.

`HICAUSE` is defined to be the largest interrupt cause value that the implementation can write
to `__x__cause` when an interrupt is taken.

Therefore the minimum observable address is `mtvec.address & ~3` and the maximum is `(mtvec.address & ~3) + 4 x HICAUSE`.

All possible observable values must be in the <<section_cap_representable_check>>.
Software must ensure this is true when writing to <<mtvec_y>>, and the hardware sets the {ctag} to zero if any values are out of the <<section_cap_representable_check>>.

NOTE: Modifying the address of any capability outside of the <<section_cap_representable_check>> without clearing the {ctag} causes a security hole as the interpretation of the bounds changes.
Therefore requiring that all possible observable addresses are representable but not necessary in bounds is the minimum security requirement.

<<mtvec_y>> is always updated using the semantics of the <<SCADDR>> instruction and so writing a sealed capability will cause the {ctag} to be set to zero.

NOTE: The capability in <<mtvec_y>> is _not_ unsealed when it is written to <<pcc>>, unlike other executing from other CSRs such as <<mepc_y>>.

<<mtvec_y>> follows the rule from `mtvec` about not needing to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses (see <<section_invalid_addr_conv>>).

[#mscratch_y, reftext="mscratch ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== Machine Scratch Capability Register (mscratch)

The <<mscratch>> register is extended to hold a capability.

{TAG_RESET_MCSR}

It is not WARL, all capability fields must be implemented.

.Machine-mode scratch capability register
include::img/mscratchcreg.edn[]

[#mepc_y,reftext="mepc ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== Machine Exception Program Counter Capability (mepc)

The <<mepc>> is extended to hold a capability.
Its reset value is nominally a <<root-rx-cap>> capability.

.Machine exception program counter capability register
include::img/mepccreg.edn[]

`mepc.address` is the `mepc` CSR, and so the follows the standard rules meaning that:

.  `mepc.address[0]=0`, and
.  `mepc.address[1]=0` when IALIGN is fixed to 32
.  `mepc.address[1]` reads as zero when IALIGN is programmable and is set to 32

As listed above for <<mtvec_y>>, this means that `mepc.address` can represent multiple different values.
Therefore software must ensure that all possible values are in the <<section_cap_representable_check>> on writing, otherwise the hardware sets the written {ctag} to zero.

Sealed capabilities may be written to <<mepc_y>>.
The {ctag} is set to zero on writing if:

.  `mepc.address[0]=1`, or
.  `mepc.address[1]=1` when IALIGN=32

In the following case the value of the {ctag} observable in the CSR depends on the value of IALIGN:

. <<mepc_y>> is sealed, the {ctag} is set, and
. `mepc.address[1]=1` and IALIGN=16 when writing the CSR

The {ctag} is zero then IALIGN=32 when reading the CSR, or executing <<MRET_CHERI>>, and the {ctag} is one when IALIGN=16.

When a trap is taken into M-mode, the pc is written to `mepc.address` following the standard behavior.
The {ctag} and metadata of the <<pcc>> are also written to <<mepc_y>>.

On execution of an <<MRET_CHERI>> instruction, the capability value from <<mepc_y>> is unsealed and written to <<pcc>>.

<<mepc_y>> follows the rule from `mepc` about not needing to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses (see <<section_invalid_addr_conv>>).

[#mtidc,reftext="mtidc"]
==== Machine Thread Identifier Capability (mtidc)

The <<mtidc>> register is used to identify the current software thread in machine mode, using the method defined in the section for the unprivileged <<utidc>> CSR.
On reset the {ctag} of <<mtidc>> will be set to zero and the remainder
of the data is UNSPECIFIED.

.Machine thread identifier capability register
include::img/mtidcreg.edn[]

[#mycfg,reftext="mycfg"]
==== Machine CHERI Capability Encoding (mycfg)
The <<mycfg>> register is used to identify which CHERI capability encoding is used by the platform.
The capability encoding both determines the in-memory representation of a CHERI capability
and entails a set of extensions present atop {cheri_base_ext_name}.
The CSR exists in the _writable_ namespace and all bits are defined to be WARL,
but, absent any future extensions, it is expected that each implementation has exactly one legal value.
For the meaning of the individual fields, refer to the <<uycfg>> register in the unprivileged specification.

include::img/ycfgreg.edn[]

=== Machine-Level CSRs modified by {cheri_base_ext_name}

[#mstatus_cheri, reftext="mstatus"]
==== Machine Status Registers (mstatus and mstatush)

The *mstatus* and *mstatush* registers operate as described in
<<mstatus_cheri>> with two restrictions:

* The <<xlen-control, MXL, SXL and UXL>> fields that control the
value of XLEN for S-mode and U-mode must be read-only and equal to MXL in {cheri_base_ext_name} implementations.
  Only 1 and 2 are supported values.

* The <<endianness-control,MBE, SBE, and UBE>> fields that control the memory system endianness for M-mode, S-mode, and U-mode must be read-only in {cheri_base_ext_name} implementations.
   SBE and UBE must be read only and equal to MBE, if S-mode or
U-mode, respectively, is implemented, or read-only zero otherwise.

Changing XLEN or endianness would change the interpretation of all in-memory capabilities, so allowing these fields to change at runtime is prohibited.

NOTE: These restrictions may be relaxed by a future extension. Such an extension is likely to enforce the constraint that any privilege level with XLEN less than MXLEN has CHERI disabled.

MXR has no effect on the CHERI permission checking.

NOTE: CHERI does not need to make use execute only memory for security reasons, and so MXR has no relevance.
 Additionally the 32-bit encoding format does not allow <<x_perm>> to be encoded without <<r_perm>>.

[[cheri-mcause]]
==== Machine Cause Register (mcause)

{cheri_base_ext_name} adds new exception codes for CHERI exceptions that <<mcause>> must be able to represent.
The new exception codes and priorities are listed in
xref:mcauses[xrefstyle=short] and xref:exception-priority-cheri[xrefstyle=short] respectively.

^1^ {pcc} bounds are checked against all bytes of fetched instructions.
 If the instructions could not be decoded to determine the length, then the <<pcc>> bounds check is made against the minimum sized instruction supported by the implementation which can be executed, when prioritizing against Instruction Access Faults.

^2^ The higher priority {cheri_excep_name_pte_ld} covers capability loads or atomics where the loaded {ctag} _is not_ checked ({cheri_priv_crg_ext} is implemented) .

^3^ The lower priority {cheri_excep_name_pte_ld} covers capability loads or atomics where the loaded {ctag} _is_ checked ({cheri_priv_crg_load_tag_ext} is implemented).

NOTE: The full details of the CHERI exceptions are in xref:cheri_exception_combs_descriptions[xrefstyle=short].

==== Machine Trap Delegation Register (medeleg)

Bits {cheri_excep_cause_list} of <<medeleg>> refer to a valid CHERI exception and so can be used to
delegate CHERI exceptions to supervisor mode.

[#sepc_y,reftext="sepc ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== Supervisor Exception Program Counter Capability (sepc)

The <<sepc>> register is extended to hold a capability.

{ROOT_RX_RESET_SCSR}

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<sepc_y>> is a code capability, so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses (see <<section_invalid_addr_conv>>).
Additionally, the capability in <<sepc_y>> is unsealed when it is written to <<pcc>> on execution of an <<SRET_CHERI>> instruction.
The handling of <<sepc_y>> is otherwise identical to <<mepc_y>>, but in supervisor mode.

The new exception code is listed in xref:scauses[xrefstyle=short].
The behavior and usage of <<scause>> otherwise remains as described in xref:scause[xrefstyle=short].

<<stval>> is updated following the same rules as <<mtval-cheri>> for CHERI exceptions
and <<cheri_pte_fault,CHERI page faults>> which are delegated to HS-mode or S-mode.

[#sec_cheri_exception_handling]
=== CHERI Exception handling

CHERI faults are typically higher priority than standard RISC-V faults. E.g., CHERI faults on the <<pcc>> are higher priority than any other fault effecting the program counter such as instruction access fault.

NOTE: `auth_cap` is `{cs1}`, unless in {cheri_int_mode_name} when it is <<ddc>> (if {cheri_default_ext_name} is implemented).

NOTE: <<CBO_ZERO_CHERI>> is performed as a cache block wide store.  All
CMOs operate on the cache block which contains the address.  Prefetch instructions check
that the authorizing capability is has its {ctag} set, is not sealed, has the required permission (<<r_perm>>,
<<w_perm>>, <<x_perm>>) corresponding to the instruction, and has bounds which
include at least one byte of the cache block; if any check fails, the prefetch
is not performed but no exception is generated.

[#CHERI_SPEC,reftext="CHERI Exceptions and speculative execution"]
=== CHERI Exceptions and speculative execution

#should be non-normative - and needs more details - move to appendix?#

CHERI adds architectural guarantees that can prove to be microarchitecturally useful.
Speculative-execution attacks can -- among other factors -- rely on instructions that fail CHERI permission checks not to take effect.
When implementing any of the extensions proposed here, microarchitects need to carefully consider the interaction of late-exception raising and side-channel attacks.

[#section_pma]
=== Physical Memory Attributes (PMA)

Typically, only parts of the entire memory space need to support CHERI {ctag}s.
Therefore, it is desirable that harts supporting {cheri_base_ext_name} extend PMAs with Physical Memory Attributes indicating whether a memory region allows storing CHERI {ctag}s.
If they are not supported, then what the behavior is when attempting to access them.

There are three levels of support:

.CHERI PMAs
[#cheri_pmas]
[width="100%",options=header]
|=========================================================================================
| PMA                          | Load Behavior    | Store Behavior                      | Comment
| _CHERI {ctag_title}_       | Load {ctag}      | Store {ctag}                        | Tagged memory supporting {ctag}s
| _CHERI {ctag_title} Strip_ | Load zero {ctag} | Ignore stored {ctag}                | No support for {ctag}s, ignore them
| _CHERI {ctag_title} Fault_ | Load zero {ctag} | Store/AMO Access Fault on {ctag}^1^ | No support for {ctag}s, trap on storing one
|=========================================================================================

^1^ The access fault is triggered on all capability stores or atomics such as <<STORE_CAP>> or <<AMOSWAP_CAP>> when <<c_perm>> and <<w_perm>> are granted and the {ctag} is set to one.

Memory regions that do not have the _CHERI {ctag_title}_ PMA do not require storage for {ctag}s.

[#section_vm]
=== Virtual Memory

CHERI checks are made on the effective address according to the current translation scheme.
I.e., on the virtual address if translation is enabled or the physical address if translation is disabled.

Implicit memory accesses made by the page table walker are not subject to CHERI checks.

NOTE: A future extension may add CHERI checks to the page table walker.


=== Modified Trap-Return Instructions Behavior

When the {cheri_base_ext_name} base ISA is implemented, the <<otherpriv,trap-return instructions>> (`MRET` and `SRET`) read the full YLEN bits of the <<mepc_y>>/<<sepc_y>> register and unseal it prior to exception return if it is a <<sentry_cap>>.

include::insns/mret_sret.adoc[]

[#section_cheri_disable]
== "{cheri_priv_m_reg_enable_ext}" Extension, Version 1.0

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* This feature is new and different from CHERI v9's
per-privilege enable bits.

NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The rules for excepting have been tightened here. Also,
it is not possible to disable CHERI checks completely.
endif::[]

When using a system with {cheri_default_ext_name}, it may be desirable to disable CHERI register and instruction access to some (or all) privilege levels such that they operate as a RV32I/RV64I system without any observable presence of CHERI features.
{cheri_default_ext_name} includes functions to disable explicit access to CHERI
registers and instructions (hereafter referred to _disabling CHERI_).

NOTE: When _CHERI is disabled_ for a specific privilege level, <<pcc>> and <<ddc>> bounds are _still_ enforced.

The {cheri_default_ext_name} extension makes the {CRE} bit of <<misa>>, <<menvcfg>>, and <<senvcfg>> writable to allow CHERI to be disabled.

//future extensions - currently they must match
//CHERI is disabled if
//
//* XLEN in the current mode is less than MXLEN, or
//* the endianness in the current mode is not the reset value of <<mstatus_cheri>>.MBE, or
//* the effective CHERI-enable for the current privilege is 0.

The effective CHERI-enable for the current privilege is:

* Machine: `<<misa>>.{CRE}`
* Supervisor: `<<misa>>.{CRE} & <<menvcfg>>.{CRE}`
* User: `<<misa>>.{CRE} & <<menvcfg>>.{CRE} & <<senvcfg>>.{CRE}`

NOTE: On reset CHERI is always disabled for backwards compatibility (<<misa>>.{CRE} resets to zero, <<ddc>> and <<pcc>> bounds are nominally root capabilities (see <<root-cap>>).

The following occurs when executing code in a privilege mode that has CHERI disabled:

* Instructions from <<rvy_insn_table>> and <<rvy_hybrid_insn_table>> cause illegal instruction exceptions.
* Executing CSR instructions accessing any natively YLEN CSR causes an illegal instruction exception.
* Executing CSR instructions accessing any CSR extended to YLEN only allows XLEN access (this is identical to {cheri_int_mode_name} access).

Disabling CHERI has no effect on implicit accesses or security checks.
The last capability written to <<pcc>> and <<ddc>> before disabling CHERI will be used to authorize instruction execution and data memory accesses.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling CHERI prevents low-privileged {cheri_int_mode_name} software
from interfering with the correct operation of higher-privileged {cheri_int_mode_name} software
that do not perform <<ddc>> switches on trap entry and return.

Disabling CHERI allows harts supporting CHERI to be fully
compatible with standard RISC-V, so CHERI instructions, such as <<CRAM>>, that
do not change any CHERI state, raise exceptions.
This is the default behavior on reset.

[#section_cheri_dyn_xlen]
== "{cheri_priv_m_dyn_xlen_ext}" Extension, Version 1.0

{cheri_priv_m_dyn_xlen_ext} eliminates some restrictions for SXL and UXL imposed in {cheri_priv_m_ext} to allow implementations supporting multiple base ISAs.
This extension allows the SXL, UXL, MBE, SBE, and UBE fields of <<mstatus_cheri>> to be writable (which is prohibited by {cheri_priv_m_ext} otherwise).

Changing XLEN::
Setting the SXL or UXL field to a value that is not MXLEN disables most CHERI features and instructions, as described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.
+
NOTE: If CHERI must be disabled in a mode for security reasons, software should set {CRE} to 0 regardless of the SXL and UXL fields.
+
Whenever XLEN in any mode is set to a value less than MXLEN, standard RISC-V rules are followed.
This means that all operations must ignore source operand register bits above the configured XLEN, and must sign-extend results to fill all MXLEN bits in the destination register.
Similarly, *pc* bits above XLEN are ignored, and when the *pc* is written, it is sign-extended to fill MXLEN.
The integer writing rule from CHERI is followed, so that every register write also zeroes the metadata and {ctag} of the
destination register.
+
However, CHERI operations and security checks will continue using the entire hardware register (i.e., YLEN bits) to correctly decode capability bounds.

Changing endianness::
Setting the MBE, SBE, or UBE field to a value that is not the reset value of MBE disables most CHERI features and instructions, as described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short], while in that privilege mode.

[#section_priv_cheri_vmem]
== "{cheri_priv_vmem_ext}" Extension, Version 1.0 for {cheri_base64_ext_name}

Virtual memory support for {cheri_base64_ext_name} requires at least one additional bit to be allocated in the page table entries, to control access to capabilities in virtual memory pages.

[#section_crw_bit]
=== Capability Read-Write (CRW) Bit

{cheri_priv_vmem_ext} defines the Capability Read-Write (CRW) bit in Page Table Entries (PTEs) for Sv39, Sv48, and Sv57 virtual memory systems on {cheri_base64_ext_name} harts. The CRW bit controls whether capabilities with their {ctag} set can be written to and loaded from a virtual page.

NOTE: _Sv32_ does not have any spare PTE bits, and so this bit does not exist for RV32.

IMPORTANT: Any hart that supports Sv39 must also implement {cheri_priv_vmem_ext}.

[#limit_cap_prop]
==== Limiting Capability Propagation

Page table enforcement can allow the operating system to limit the flow of capabilities between processes.
It is highly desirable that a process should only possess capabilities that have been issued for that address space by the operating system.
Unix processes may share memory for efficient communication, but capability pointers must not be shared across these channels into a foreign address space.
An operating system might defend against this by only issuing a capability to the shared region that does not grant the load/store capability permission.
However, there are circumstances where portions of general-purpose, mmapped^*^ memory become shared, and the operating system must prevent future capability communication through those pages.
This is not possible without restructuring software, as the capability for the original allocation, which spans both shared memory and private memory, would need to be deleted and replaced with a list of distinct capabilities with appropriate permissions for each range.
Such a change would not be transparent to the program.
Such sharing through virtual memory is on the page granularity, so preventing capability writes with a PTE permission is a natural solution.

^*^ _allocated using mmap_

[#cheri_pte_fault]
=== CHERI page faults

CHERI adds the concept of _CHERI page faults_. They are split into :

* {cheri_excep_name_pte_ld} (cause value {cheri_excep_cause_pte_ld}), and
* {cheri_excep_name_pte_st} (cause value {cheri_excep_cause_pte_st})

They are prioritized against other fault types as shown in <<exception-priority-cheri>>.

{cheri_priv_vmem_ext} allows {cheri_excep_name_pte_st}s to be raised.

CHERI harts which implement {cheri_priv_vmem_ext} must also implement a revocation scheme to prevent use-after-free attacks.

The current revocation scheme (<<section_cheri_priv_crg_ext,{cheri_priv_crg_ext}>>) also allows {cheri_excep_name_pte_ld}s to be raised.

==== Extending the Page Table Entry Format

The page table entry format remains unchanged for Sv32.
However, a new bit, Capability Read-Write (CRW), is added to leaf PTEs in Sv39, Sv48 and Sv57 as shown in xref:sv39pte_crw[xrefstyle=short], xref:sv48pte_crw[xrefstyle=short] and xref:sv57pte_crw[xrefstyle=short] respectively.
For non-leaf PTEs this bit remains reserved and must be cleared by software for forward compatibility, or else a page-fault exception is raised.
Additionally, if the hypervisor extension is enabled this bit remains reserved for leaf and non-leaf PTEs used in guest address translation.

.Sv39 page table entry
[#sv39pte_crw]

[#sv48pte_crw]
include::img/sv48pte_crw.edn[]

.Sv57 page table entry
[#sv57pte_crw]
include::img/sv57pte_crw.edn[]

The CRW bit indicates whether reading or writing capabilities with the {ctag} set to the virtual page is permitted.
When the CRW bit is set, capabilities are written as usual.

If the CRW bit is clear then:

* When a capability load or AMO instruction is executed, the {ctag} bit of the
loaded capability is cleared before it is written to the destination register.
* A <<cheri_pte_fault,_{cheri_excep_name_pte_st}_>> exception is raised when a capability store or AMO instruction is executed and the {ctag} bit of the to-be-stored capability is set.

|===

[NOTE]
====
The {ctag} bit of the stored capability is checked _after_ it is potentially cleared due to missing permissions.
Therefore, the behavior in this section isn't relevant if:

* The authorizing capability doesn't have <<c_perm>>.
* Any extension-specific mediation has already cleared the {ctag} of the to-be-stored capability.

[#section_invalid_addr_conv,reftext="Invalid address conversion"]
=== Invalid Address Handling

When address translation is in effect and MXLEN=64, the upper bits of virtual
memory addresses must match for the address to be valid.

The CSRs shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], as well as the pc, need not hold all possible invalid addresses.
Implementations may convert an invalid address into some other invalid address that the register is capable of holding.

However, the bounds encoding of capabilities depends on the address value if the bounds are not infinite.

Therefore implementations must not convert invalid addresses to other arbitrary invalid addresses in an unrestricted manner if the bounds are not infinite.

If the bounds could not be decoded due to the address being invalid, then a _{cheri_excep_name_pc}_, _{cheri_excep_name_ld}_ or _{cheri_excep_name_st}_ exception is raised as appropriate.

NOTE: In all cases, if the authorizing capability has bounds that cover all addresses, then the behavior is identical to the normal RISC-V behavior without CHERI.

NOTE: Not requiring to the implementation to decode the bounds for invalid addresses reduces the size of bounds comparators from 64-bits to the supported virtual address width.

==== Updating CSRs

A CSR may be updated to hold a capability with an invalid address, due to:

* executing instructions, such as <<CSRRW_CHERI>>
* hardware updates to CSRs such as storing the <<pcc>> into  <<mepc_y>>/<<sepc_y>> etc. when taking an exception.

To ensure that the bounds of a valid capability cannot be corrupted:

* If the new address is invalid and the capability bounds do not cover all addresses, then set the {ctag} to zero before writing to the CSR.

NOTE: When the capability's address is invalid and happens to match an invalid address which the CSR
can hold, then it is implementation defined whether to set the {ctag} to zero.

==== Branches and Jumps

If the effective target address of the jump or branch is invalid, and the authorizing capability's bounds do not cover all addresses, then set the {ctag} of the target <<pcc>> to zero.
This will cause a {cheri_excep_name_pc} exception when executing the target instruction.

NOTE: RISC-V harts that do not support {cheri_base_ext_name} normally raise an
instruction access fault or page fault after jumping or branching to an invalid address.
Therefore, {cheri_base_ext_name} aims to preserve that behavior to ensure that
harts supporting {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} are fully
compatible with RISC-V harts provided that <<pcc>> and <<ddc>> are set to
<<root-rx-cap>> and <<root-rw-cap>> capabilities, respectively.

==== Memory Accesses

If the effective address of the memory access is invalid, and the authorizing capability's bounds do not cover all addresses, then raise a {cheri_excep_name_ld} or {cheri_excep_name_st} exception because the bounds cannot be reliably decoded.
