== {cheri_base32_ext_name} and {cheri_base64_ext_name} Base Capability Instruction Sets, Version 1.0

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
WARNING: This chapter will appear in the unpriv spec after the RV32I chapter.
endif::[]

#ARC-COMMENT: A fundamental descriptive problem in this narrative is that capabilities are being viewed as variables not as values.  A capability is never modified in place - a new capability value is being created from an existing capability value by instructions.  This confusion makes it more difficult to understand instruction descriptions which operate on values and place them in variables (registers and memory locations).#

This chapter describes the {cheri_base32_ext_name} and {cheri_base64_ext_name} base capability instruction sets, that extend the RV32I and RV64I (or RV32E/RV64E) integer instruction sets with CHERI.
If the hart supports RV32E/RV64E instead of RV32I/RV64I, {cheri_base_ext_name} the restrictions from <<rv32e>> apply and 16 general purpose registers instead of 32 -- but all other {cheri_base_ext_name} changes are identical so the remainder of this chapter only refers to extending RV32I/RV64I behavior.

CHERI enhances the base ISA to add hardware memory access control.
It has an additional memory access mechanism that protects _references to code and data_ (pointers), rather than the _location of code and data_ (integer addresses).
This mechanism is implemented by providing a new primitive, called a *capability*, that software components can use to implement strongly protected pointers within an address space.
Capabilities are unforgeable and delegatable tokens of authority that grant software the ability to perform a specific set of operations.
In CHERI, integer-based pointers are replaced by capabilities to provide memory access control.

=== CHERI protection model

The CHERI model is motivated by the _principle of least privilege_, which
argues that greater security can be obtained by minimizing the privileges
accessible to running software. A second guiding principle is the _principle of
intentional use_, which argues that, where many privileges are available to a
piece of software, the privilege to use should be explicitly named rather than
implicitly selected. While CHERI does not prevent the expression of vulnerable
software designs, it provides strong vulnerability mitigation: attackers have a
more limited vocabulary for attacks, and should a vulnerability be successfully
exploited, they gain fewer rights, and have reduced access to further attack
surfaces.

Protection properties for capabilities include the ISA ensuring that
capabilities are always derived via valid manipulations of other capabilities
(_provenance_), that corrupted^1^ in-memory capabilities cannot be dereferenced
(_integrity_), and that rights associated with capabilities shall only ever be
equal or less permissive (_monotonicity_). Tampering or modifying capabilities
in an attempt to elevate their rights will yield an invalid capability.
Attempting to dereference via an invalid capability
will result in a hardware exception.

^1^ Not all possible corrupted states are detected, see xref:section_cap_integrity[xrefstyle=full].

CHERI capabilities may be held in registers or in memories, and are loaded,
stored, and dereferenced using CHERI-aware instructions that expect capability
operands rather than integer addresses. On system initialization, initial capabilities
are made available to software by the execution environment via general purpose
registers. All other capabilities will be derived from these initial valid
capabilities through valid capability transformations.

Developers can use CHERI to build fine-grained spatial and temporal memory
protection into their system software and applications and significantly
improve their security.

[#sec_capability_registers]
=== Capability Registers and Format

#ARC note - CLEN will become YLEN#

{cheri_base_ext_name} extends all registers that have to be able to hold addresses to `2*XLEN` bits (hereafter referred to as CLEN), adding metadata to protect its integrity, limit how it is manipulated, and control its use.
In addition to widening to CLEN, each register also gains one-bit {ctag} which is defined below.

{cheri_base_ext_name} specify the fields which the capability format supports, and how those fields behave for XLEN=32 and XLEN=64.

The exact encoding format of the capability is described in <<app_cap_description>>.

NOTE: Future extensions may redefine the capability format providing they follow the rules defined by the {cheri_base_ext_name} base ISA.

==== Address

The lower XLEN bits of a capability encode the address of where the capability points.
This is also referred to as the integer part of the capability.
For registers that are extended but currently hold non-capability data, all other fields are typically zero.

NOTE: Future extensions may add 2*XLEN-bit operations to make use of the wide registers for efficient handling of 2*XLEN-bit non-capability data.

[#cap_valid_tag,reftext="{ctag}"]
==== {ctag_title}

The {ctag} is an additional bit added to addressable memory and all CLEN-bit registers.
It is stored separately and may be referred to as _out of band_ or _hidden_, and is _hardware managed_.
It indicates whether a CLEN-bit register or CLEN-aligned memory location contains a valid capability.
If the {ctag} is set, the capability is valid and can be dereferenced (contingent on checks such as permissions or <<sec_cap_bounds_overview,bounds>>).

All registers or memory locations able to hold a capability are CLEN bits wide with an additional hidden {ctag} bit.
These are referred to as being _CLEN-bit_ in this specification.

The {ctag} cannot be directly set to one by software, it is _not_ a conventionally accessible bit of state.
If the {ctag} is set then it shows that the capability has been derived correctly according to the principles listed above (_provenance_, _integrity_, _monotonicity_).
If the rules are followed then the {ctag} will propagate through the instructions that modify, load or store the capability.

Therefore, for capability manipulation in registers:

* Any instruction that wrote the capability to a register had at least one {ctag} set in its input operands.
** This is the _provenance_ check.
* Any instruction that wrote the capability to a register requested a legal operation that does not increase bounds or permissions, and set the {ctag} on the output.
** This is the _monotonicity_ check.
* Any instruction that wrote the capability to a register detected corrupted values.
** This is the _integrity_ check.

Capability load/store require the _provenance_ check:

* Any store that wrote the capability to memory was correctly authorized
* Any load that read the capability from memory was correctly authorized

When an operation fails a check, either due to software error or malicious intent, then the operation raises an exception or sets the resulting {ctag} to zero.

Using an invalid capability to dereference memory or authorize any operation raises an exception.
All capabilities derived from invalid capabilities are themselves invalid, i.e., their {ctag}s are zero.

NOTE: When the {ctag} is zero, the register or memory location may be used to store non-capability data.

==== Capability tags in registers

Every CLEN-bit register has a one-bit {ctag}, indicating whether the capability in the register is valid to be dereferenced.
This {ctag} is cleared whenever an invalid capability operation is performed.
Examples of such invalid operations include writing only the integer portion (the address field) of the register or attempting to increase bounds or permissions.

==== Capability tags in memory

Capability tags are tracked through the memory subsystem: every aligned CLEN-bit wide region has a non-addressable one-bit {ctag}, which the hardware manages atomically with the data.
The {ctag} is set to zero if any byte in the CLEN/8 aligned memory region is ever written using an operation other than a store of a capability operand which is permitted to set the {ctag} to one (see <<c_perm>>), and that the stored capability data has its {ctag} set.

NOTE: All system memory and caches that store capabilities must preserve this abstraction, handling the {ctag}s atomically with the data.

[#sec_cap_bounds_overview]
==== Capability Bounds

Capabilities encode memory bounds, i.e., the lowest and highest byte in memory that it is permitted to access when dereferenced for data memory access, or for instruction execution.

Checking is on a byte-by-byte basis, so that it is possible for a memory access to be fully in-bounds, partially out-of-bounds or fully out-of-bounds.

It is not permitted to make any partially or fully out-of-bounds memory accesses.

Every capability has two memory address bounds: _base_ representing the lowest accessible byte, and _top_ representing one byte above the highest accessible byte.

* The _base_ is XLEN bits and is _inclusive_.
* The _top_ is (XLEN+1)-bits and is _exclusive_.
** The extra bit is required to allow the bounds to include the top byte of memory.
* The _length_ is (XLEN+1)-bits and is defined to be _top - base_.

Therefore a memory location `A` in the range `base &#8804; A < top` is within bounds, and so valid to access.

NOTE: Inclusive _top_, with XLEN bits, was considered but rejected in favor of the exclusive _top_.

NOTE: Checking every byte of every executed instruction and every byte of every data memory access is fundamental to the memory safety which CHERI provides.
In a typical load/store unit, the expansion of the bounds from `cs1` and bounds checking is in parallel with the address calculation, the memory translation and/or the PMA/PMP checking.

A compressed format is used to encode the bounds with a scheme similar to floating-point using an exponent and a mantissa.
Therefore small exponents can allow byte granularity on the bounds, but larger exponents give coarser granularity.

The bounds encoding format is defined in <<section_cap_bounds>>.

NOTE: Future extensions may redefine the bounds encoding format.
  #ARC-COMMENT: if they redefine, then they wouldn't be a straightforward extension, but an incompatible alternative?#

Software can query the capability bounds:

* The _base_ is returned by the <<GCBASE>> instruction.
* The _length_ is returned by the <<GCLEN>> instruction.
** <<GCLEN>> saturates the _length_ to XLEN bits
* The _top_ can be calculated using a saturating addition of the <<GCBASE>> and <<GCLEN>> results.

NOTE: A future extension may add an instruction to directly read the _top_ if needed for performance.

==== Updating the Bounds

On system initialization the <<infinite-cap>> capability is available which has bounds which cover all of memory, and maximum permissions set.
All smaller capabilities are derived from this.

The ISA does not allow the bounds (and permissions) of a capability with its {ctag} set to be increased (_monotonicity_).

Bounds can be programmed using the <<SCBNDS>>, <<SCBNDSI>> and <<SCBNDSR>> instructions, which set the current address to be the _base_ bound and the _length_ to be the operand (`rs1` or `imm`) value.
The granularity constraints means that not all requested combinations of _top_ and _base_ bounds can be encoded exactly.

* <<SCBNDS>> sets the _base_ to `cs1.address`, and the _length_ to `rs1`. Set the {ctag} to zero if the bounds cannot be encoded exactly.
* <<SCBNDSI>> sets the _base_ to `cs1.address`, and the _length_ to the immediate value. Set the {ctag} to zero if the bounds cannot be encoded exactly.
* <<SCBNDSR>> sets the _base_ to `cs1.address`, and the _length_ to `rs1`. The bounds may be rounded up if they cannot be encoded exactly.
** If <<SCBNDSR>> rounds up the requested bounds, they must still be no larger than the initial bounds.
* <<CRAM>> can be used to calculate the nearest precisely encodable _length_ and _base_ values for a given size.

// #some example usage here of CRAM+SCBNDSR would be good#

The bounds are encoded relative to the address field, sharing some upper bits of the address.
The number of shared bits depends on the exponent, see xref:section_cap_bounds[xrefstyle=short].

NOTE: Early versions of CHERI encoded the top and bottom bounds as full width addresses.
This proved to be impractical for real systems, and so the https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/pdfs/2019tc-cheri-concentrate.pdf[CHERI-concentrate] compressed system was developed to reduce the overhead.

==== Representability and Updating the Address

Because the CHERI concentrate encoding scheme shares the upper bits of the address with the bounds, not all out-of-bounds pointers can be represented.
The maximum range of address values that the pointer can take without changing the interpretation of bounds is defined by the <<section_cap_representable_check, representable region>>.
Since capability address modification could change the meaning of the bounds, all updates to registers (e.g., modification of the program counter via control-flow instructions) and instructions that return capabilities with a modified address must check that the new address is also within the representable region.
If the interpretation of bounds _has_ changed, then the {ctag} is set to zero, so that the capability is invalid for use.

Software can create a new capability with an updated address using the <<SCADDR>> instruction.

NOTE: <<SCADDR>> writes back a new capability with a modified address field and, if the {ctag} was previously set, sets the {ctag} of the output if the resulting capability still has the same bounds interpretation.

NOTE: Existing software sometimes temporarily moves pointers outside of arrays, and then only come back into the valid range on dereference, so the encoding was designed to allow valid capabilities to be out-of-bounds.

NOTE: {cheri_base_ext_name} implementations that use a different encoding scheme to the default (e.g., for accelerators or specific micro-controllers) may specify an alternative to the representable region check, and may never allow the address to be out of bounds.
Therefore, the rest of the specification uses the phrase *represented exactly* for this check.

The bounds and representable region (or space) are illustrated in <<cap_bounds_map>>.
E, MW and R in the figure are all introduced in xref:section_cap_bounds_decoding[xrefstyle=short] along with the bounds decoding.

[#sec_cap_type, reftext="CT-field"]
==== Capability Type (CT)

This metadata field indicates the type of the capability.
The type determines which operations the capability authorizes.
The following capability types are defined in {cheri_base_ext_name}:

.Capability types in {cheri_base_ext_name}
[#tab_cap_types,width="50%",options=header,align="center"]
|===
|Type |Hardware interpretation

|0    | Unsealed capability
|1    | Sealed entry (sentry) capability
|===

NOTE: Future extensions will add more types of sealed capabilities by extending the width of the CT-field.
 In the base ISA, sentries are the only type of sealed capability and the CT field is only 1-bit.

[#unsealed_cap,reftext="unsealed capability]
Unsealed capabilities::
When `CT=0`, the capability authorizes access to a region of memory as defined by the permissions and bounds.

[#sealed_cap,reftext="sealed capability"]
Sealed capabilities::
Capabilities with `CT≠0` are sealed against modification.
They cannot be dereferenced to access memory and it is not permitted to change the address, bounds or permissions.
Modifications are restricted to _reducing_ the <<section_cap_level, CL>> field using <<ACPERM>>.

When a sealed capability is used as a function pointer it is known as a <<sentry_cap>>.

[#sentry_cap,reftext="sentry capability"]
==== Sentry Capabilities
Sentries describe secure function entry points.
They have a <<sec_cap_type>> of 1.

They are used as the target of <<JALR_CHERI>>, which must have a zero offset for the use of a sentry to be valid.

Sentry capabilities can establish a form of control-flow integrity between mutually distrusting code.
<<JALR_CHERI>> with zero offset automatically unseals a sentry target capability and installs it in the <<pcc,program counter capability>>.

<<JALR_CHERI>> also seals the return register, so the callee can return to the caller but cannot access the memory pointed at by the return register, and cannot return elsewhere.

NOTE: In addition to using sealed capabilities as sentries for secure entry points, sealed capabilities can also be useful to software as secure software tokens.
 They can be converted to an unsealed capability by extracting the metadata with <<GCHI>>, zeroing the `CT` field, reapplying it with <<SCHI>> and then rebuilding via a superset capability with the <<CBLD>> instruction.
 A future extension may add an unseal instruction for performance.

[#AP-field, reftext="AP-field"]
==== Architectural Permissions (AP)

This metadata field encodes architecturally defined permissions of the capability.
Permissions grant access subject to the <<cap_valid_tag>> being set, the capability being unsealed, and bounds checks passing.
Any operation is also contingent on requirements imposed by other RISC-V architectural features, such as virtual memory, PMP and PMAs, even if the capability grants sufficient permissions.
The permissions currently defined in {cheri_base_ext_name} are listed below.

Permissions can only be removed using <<ACPERM>> on valid capabilities, they cannot be added.

NOTE: The encoding of permissions varies with MXLEN and is described in xref:AP-field-encoding[xrefstyle=full].

[#r_perm,reftext="R-permission"]
Read Permission \(R):: Allow reading data from memory.

[#w_perm,reftext="W-permission"]
Write Permission (W):: Allow writing data to memory.

[#x_perm,reftext="X-permission"]
Execute Permission (X):: Allow instruction execution.

[#c_perm,reftext="C-permission"]
Capability Permission \(C)::
Allow reading {ctag}s from memory if <<r_perm>> is also granted.
+
Allow writing {ctag}s to memory if <<w_perm>> is also granted..
+
If <<c_perm>> is missing then the {ctag}s for capability loads and stores are read and written as zero.

[#lm_perm,reftext="LM-permission"]
Load Mutable Permission (LM):: Allow preserving the <<w_perm>> of capabilities loaded from memory.
If a capability grants <<r_perm>> and <<c_perm>>, but no <<lm_perm>>, then a capability loaded via this authorizing capability will have <<w_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> removed.
+
The permission stripping behavior _only_ applies to loaded capabilities that have their {ctag} set and are not sealed.
This ensures that capability loads of non-capability data do not modify the loaded value, and that sealed capabilities are not modified.

NOTE: Clearing a capability's <<lm_perm>> and <<w_perm>> allows sharing a read-only version of a data structure (e.g., a tree or linked list) without making a copy.

[#sl_perm,reftext="SL-permission"]
Store Level Permission (SL):: This field allows limiting the propagation of capabilities using the following logic:
+
Capabilities with a <<section_cap_level>> (see below) less than the inverse of the authorizing capability's <<sl_perm>> will be stored with a zero {ctag}.#ARC-COMMENT: Introduce levels earlier.#
+
In the base ISA this is a single bit comparison, behaving as follows:

* If this field (as well as <<c_perm>> and <<w_perm>>) is set to one then capabilities may be stored via this capability regardless of their associated <<section_cap_level>>.
* If this field is zero, then any capability with a <<section_cap_level>> of zero (i.e., _local_), will be stored with the {ctag} cleared.

NOTE: Future extensions may make this field wider to enable more use cases.

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: For `LVLBITS=1` this permission is equivalent to _StoreLocal_ in CHERI v9, Morello and CHERIoT.
endif::[]

[#el_perm,reftext="EL-permission"]
Elevate Level Permission (EL):: Any unsealed capability with its {ctag} set to one that is loaded from memory has its <<el_perm>> cleared and its <<section_cap_level>> restricted to the authorizing capability's <<section_cap_level>> if the authorizing capability does not grant <<el_perm>>.
+
If sealed, then only <<section_cap_level,CL>> is modified, <<el_perm>> is unchanged.
+
This permission is similar to the existing <<lm_perm>>, but instead of applying to the <<w_perm>> on the loaded capability it restricts the <<section_cap_level,CL>> field.

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* This permission does not exist in CHERI v9, but is similar to CHERIoT's _LoadGlobal_ permission, except that any _global_ capability implicitly grants _LoadGlobal_.
endif::[]

[#asr_perm,reftext="ASR-permission"]
Access System Registers Permission (ASR, primarily used to authorize CSR accesses):: Allow read and write access to all privileged CSRs, some unprivileged CSRs and some privileged instructions.
In {cheri_base_ext_name}, the only affected CSR is the unprivileged <<utidc>> CSR, which requires <<asr_perm>> for writing, but not for reading.
ASR permission is used for additional permission checks by some instructions from other extensions such as <<Zicbom>>.

NOTE: This permission is important in privileged execution environments.
  Removing this permission allows constraining privileged software to a sandbox that cannot be subverted by changing privileged state.

NOTE: Extensions may add additional non-privileged CSRs that require <<asr_perm>>.

[#section_cap_level,reftext="Capability Level (CL)"]
==== Capability Level (CL)

The _Capability Level_ (CL) field allows enforcing invariants on capability propagation. It affects data memory accesses.

For example, the _Capability Level_ can be used to ensure that a callee can only write a copy of the passed-in argument capability to specific locations in memory (e.g., the callee's stack frame but not the heap).
It can also be used to avoid sharing of compartment-local data (such as pointers to a stack object) between compartments.

NOTE: This specification only defines the architectural mechanics of this feature, for further information on how this can be used by software please refer to cite:[cheri-v9-spec].

The _Capability Level_ can hold two values:

* 1: the capability is _global_, in general allowing it to be stored using any authorizing capability.
* 0: the capability is _local_, and can only be stored by authorizing capabilities with the <<sl_perm>> set.

Furthermore, the <<el_perm>> can be used to restrict loading of _global_ capabilities -- causing the hardware to automatically set the level of loaded capabilities to _local_ instead.

As with permissions, the _Capability Level_ of a valid capability can only be decreased but never increased (without deriving from a capability with a higher level).
But unlike architectural permissions, the _Capability Level_ can be reduced even if the capability is sealed.

endif::[]

[#sec_cap_sdp]
==== Software-Defined Permissions (SDP)
The metadata also contains an encoding-dependent number of software-defined permission (SDP) bits.
They can be inspected by the kernel or application programs to enforce restrictions on API calls (e.g., permit/deny system calls, memory allocation, etc.).
They can be cleared by <<ACPERM>> but are not interpreted by the CPU otherwise.

While these bits are not used by the hardware as architectural permissions, modification follows the same rules: SDP bits can only be cleared and never set on valid capabilities.

NOTE: This property is required to ensure restricted programs cannot forge capabilities that would pass the software-enforced checks.

[#section_special_caps]
==== Special Capabilities

[#infinite-cap,reftext="Infinite"]
===== Infinite Capability

The _Infinite_ capability grants all permissions, has the maximum <<section_cap_level,CL-field>>, and its bounds cover the whole 2^MXLEN^ address space.
The address field can hold any value.

All capability checks pass when performed against a valid <<infinite-cap>> capability.
The encoding of the _Infinite_ capability is described in <<section_infinite_cap_encoding>>.

NOTE: The _Infinite_ capability is also known as 'default', 'almighty', or 'root' capability in other CHERI documentation.

[#null-cap,reftext="NULL"]
===== NULL Capability
A capability with all-zero metadata, a zero {ctag}, and an address of zero is referred to as the _NULL_ capability.
This capability grants no permissions and any dereference results in raising an exception.

=== Extended State

As stated above, all state which can hold addresses are extended from XLEN to CLEN bits.

==== General Purpose Registers

#ARC note C registers will become Y registers#

The <<gprs,XLEN-wide integer registers>> (e.g., `sp`, `a0`) are all extended to CLEN bits.

#FIXME: need to avoid separate names#
When referring to the extended registers, the `x` prefix is replaced with a `c`: i.e., the extended version of `x1` becomes `c1`.
The register can be referred to either way - as `c1` accessing all CLEN bits or as `x1` accessing only the address field (i.e., the lower XLEN bits).
For the ABI register names the `c` prefix is added, e.g., `csp` to refer to all CLEN bits, and so the assembler can refer to either `sp` or `csp`.

The zero register is extended with zero metadata and a zero {ctag}: this is called the <<null-cap>> capability.

[#pcc,reftext="pcc"]
==== The Program Counter Capability (`pcc`)

The `pc` is extended to be the Program Counter Capability.
Extending the `pc` allows the range of branches, jumps and linear execution for currently executing code to be restricted.
The <<pcc>> address field is the `pc` in the base RISC-V ISA so that the
hardware automatically updates it as instructions are executed.

The hardware performs the following checks on <<pcc>> for each instruction
executed in addition to the checks already required by the base RISC-V ISA.
A failing check raises a CHERI exception.

* The {ctag} must be set
* The capability must not be sealed
* The capability must grant execute permission
* All bytes of the instruction must be in bounds
* All <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks passed.

On system initialization the `pc` bounds and permissions must be set such that the program can run successfully (e.g., by setting it to <<infinite-cap>> to ensure _all_ instructions are in bounds).

NOTE: Future ISA extensions should respect these rules so that the checked bits do not need storing in all copies of the <<pcc>> in the implementation.

[#utidc,reftext="utidc"]
===== User Thread Identifier Capability (utidc)

The <<utidc>> register is used to identify the current software thread in user mode.
Any operation that modifies <<utidc>> raises an exception unless the <<asr_perm>> is set in the current <<pcc>>.

NOTE: While the RISC-V ABI includes a _thread pointer (tp)_ register, it is not usable for the purpose of reliably identifying the current software thread because the tp register is a general purpose register and can be changed arbitrarily by untrusted code.
Therefore, this specification offers an additional CSR that facilitates a trusted source for identifying software threads.

.User thread identifier capability register
include::img/utidcreg.edn[]

[NOTE]
=====
#The following should probably move to a programmers guide#

Compartmentalization seeks to separate the privileges between different
protection units, e.g., two or more libraries. Code can be separated by sentries,
which allow for giving out code capabilities to untrusted code where the untrusted
code can only call the code capability, but not modify it. The <<utidc>> register supports
a model where untrusted code is separated by trusted code and each call from one piece of untrusted
code to another piece of untrusted piece of code goes through trusted code. Often, the trusted
code is referred to as a *trampoline*. Sentries can
be called from different software threads and thus there needs to be a way of
identifying the current software thread. While identifying the current software thread
can be done by privileged code, e.g., the kernel, the implied performance
overhead of this is not bearable for CHERI systems with many compartments.

The <<utidc>> register is designed to hold a capability, which can only be used for memory accesses by
trusted code. In a commonly used model on CHERI systems, the trusted code's responsibility
is only to switch between compartments, but not to switch threads. This responsibility is usually
taken over by more privileged code, e.g., an operating system kernel running on a different privilege level.
The privileged code switches software threads and writes the <<utidc>> register.

Every piece of code in the user space (and more privileged levels) can read the contents of the <<utidc>>
register. However, the memory authorized by the capability in <<utidc>> must not be accessible to untrusted code,
but only to trusted code. In order to protect this capability, it can be made a sentry (thus being sealed). The
trusted code will be given a capability large enough so that it can recover the sentry stored in <<utidc>>.
For the untrusted code, the sentry stored in <<utidc>> is inaccessible. The sentry itself is no secret, but the
memory pointed to by the sentry is a secret and must not be accessed by any untrusted code.

Trusted code can use the sentry in <<utidc>> to implement secure compartment switches. Often, the sentry is
used to implement a trusted stack. Whenever a compartment switch happens, the trusted code can pass arguments between
the caller and callee compartment avoid capability leaks between the two compartments.
The trusted code can store capabilities on the trusted stack when calling out of a compartment and can install them
when returning to the same compartment.
=====

==== Extended CSRs

All CSRs that can hold addresses are extended to CLEN bits.

{cheri_base_ext_name} has three classes of CSR:

. XLEN-bit CSRs, which do not contain addresses
.. e.g., _fcsr_ from the "F" extension
. XLEN-bit CSRs extended to CLEN bits, which are able to contain addresses (referred to as _extended CSRs_)
.. e.g., _jvt_ from the "Zcmt" extension
. CLEN-bit CSRs, which are added by {cheri_base_ext_name} and contain addresses
.. e.g., <<utidc>>

When accessing CSRs these rules are followed:

. Accesses to XLEN-bit CSRs are as specified by Zicsr
. Accesses to CLEN-bit CSRs and extended CSRs, using CSRRW will:
.. Read CLEN bits
.. Write CLEN bits, and will write the {ctag} to zero if:
... any <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> check fails
. Accesses to CLEN-bit CSRs and extended CSRs, using encodings other than CSRRW will:
.. Read CLEN bits
.. Write an XLEN-bit value to the address field, and use <<SCADDR>> semantics to determine the final written value

NOTE: Any CLEN-bit or extended CSR may have additional rules defined to determine the final written value of the metadata and/or to write zero to the {ctag}.

The assembler pseudoinstruction to read a capability CSR `csrr cd, csr`, is encoded as `csrrs cd, csr, c0`.

[#sec_cap_checks]
=== Capability checks

With {cheri_base_ext_name}, every memory access performed by a CHERI core must be authorized by a capability.

Instruction fetches, branches, jumps, and data memory accesses may result in a fatal exception if the access is out of <<sec_cap_bounds_overview,bounds>>, or if the authorizing capability is missing the required <<AP-field,permissions>>. I.e.,:

* all load instructions requires <<r_perm>>
* all store instructions require <<w_perm>>
* all indirect jumps require <<x_perm>> on the target capability

NOTE: See <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details on the exception reporting mechanism.

Instruction fetch is also authorized by a capability: the program counter capability (<<pcc>>) which extends the PC.
This allows code fetch to be bounded, preventing a wide range of attacks that subvert control flow with non-capability data.

The authorizing capability is either named explicitly (the base register of a load/store operation) or implicitly (when executing a branch, <<pcc>> is used for authorization).

E.g., `lw t0, 16(csp)` loads a word from memory, getting the address, bounds, and permissions from the `csp` (capability stack pointer) register.

 No other exception paths are added by {cheri_base_ext_name}: in particular, capability manipulations do not raise an exception, but may set {ctag} of the resulting capability to zero if the operation is not permitted.

=== Added Instructions
{cheri_base_ext_name} adds new instructions to operate on capabilities.
To clarify whether an instruction accesses XLEN or CLEN bits of the register, the instruction listing uses `cd/cs1/cs2` for capability operands and `rd/rs1/rs2` for integer operands.

=== Instructions to Update The Capability Pointer

 Creating a new capability with a different address (i.e., updating the pointer) requires specific instructions instead of integer ADD/ADDI.
 These instructions all include a check that the resulting address can be <<section_cap_representable_check,represented exactly>> within the new capability.

=== Instructions to Manipulate Capabilities

For security, capabilities can only be modified in restricted ways.
Special instructions are provided to copy capabilities or derive a new capability using manipulations such as _shrinking_ the bounds (<<SCBNDS>>), _reducing_ the permissions (<<ACPERM>>) or _authorizing_ a capability with another one which has a superset (or identical) bounds and permissions (<<CBLD>>).

[#sec_cap_load_store]
=== Instructions to Load and Store Capability Data

New loads and stores are introduced to handle capability data, <<LC>> and <<SC>>.
They atomically access CLEN bits of data and the associated {ctag}.

All capability memory accesses check for <<c_perm>> in the authorizing capability in `cs1`.

If <<c_perm>> is granted then:

#ARC-NOTE: SC has name clash with "store conditional" in A extension. Suggest LY, SY.#
* <<LC>> reads CLEN bits of data from memory, and returns the associated {ctag}.
* <<SC>> writes CLEN bits of data to memory, and writes the associated {ctag}.

If <<c_perm>> is not granted then:

* <<LC>> reads CLEN bits from memory, but does not return the associated {ctag}, instead zero is returned.
* <<SC>> writes CLEN bits to memory, and writes zero to the associated {ctag}.

//NOTE: Future extensions to {cheri_base_ext_name} may add mechanisms that cause
//stores of capabilities to raise exceptions when the authorizing capability does not grant both
//<<w_perm>> and <<c_perm>> and the stored capability has the {ctag} set.

All capability data memory access instructions require CLEN-aligned addresses, and will
take an access fault exception if this requirement is not met.
They cannot be emulated.

NOTE: An access fault is raised instead of a misaligned exception since these instructions cannot be emulated since there is one hidden {ctag} per CLEN-aligned memory region.

CAUTION: #This is a change in behavior relative to v0.9.5 (previously a misaligned exception was taken)#

All memory accesses, of any type, require permission from the authorizing capability in `cs1`.

* All loads require <<r_perm>>, otherwise they raise an exception
* All stores require <<w_perm>>, otherwise they raise an exception

//NOTE: Misaligned capability memory accesses cannot be emulated.
//  To transfer CLEN misaligned bits without a {ctag}, use integer loads and stores.

Under some circumstances <<LC>> will _modify_ the data loaded from memory before writing it back to the destination register.
See <<LC>> for details.

[#section_existing_riscv_insns]
=== Changes to Existing RISC-V Base ISA Instructions

{cheri_base_ext_name} extend existing instructions that are used for handling addresses so that they manipulate a whole capability.

* Whenever an input operand is used as an address (e.g., the load/store base address), all capability bits are fed into the instruction instead of just XLEN bits.
* Any instruction that writes back an address (e.g., <<AUIPC_CHERI>> or <<CSRRW_CHERI>>) to the destination register, writes a full capability register instead of just XLEN bits.
  For all other results the high bits of the register are zeroed.
* Whenever a capability with a new address is returned, the result is _always_ created using <<SCADDR>> semantics.

`ADD` and `ADDI` are not affected by the rule above.
Even though they _are_ used for handling addresses, they also have other uses.
New encodings are used for capability addition: <<CADD>> and <<CADDI>>.
They must be used for all address incrementing.

[NOTE]
====

Integer add (`ADD`) and capability add (<<CADD>>) have separate encodings.
Using a single encoding for both is undesirable:

 . Integer ADD is most commonly used for purposes other than address calculations.
 . For high performance implementations which can issue multiple ADDs, it means that the integer ADD units don't need the upper halves of the operands, and don't need the capability check logic on the result.
 . The compiler and/or programmer would have to execute another metadata clearing instruction after each ADD to ensure that compartments don't leak capabilities.

====

The rules above apply to the <<rv32,base ISA>> instructions listed in the following subsections, but also apply to instructions added by other extensions.
Any change to instruction semantics (or remapping of opcodes) for {cheri_base_ext_name} is called out in the chapter defining the extension.

[#section_cheri_int_load_store_insns]
==== Changes to load/stores

All load and store instructions behave as described in <<ldst>> with one fundamental difference:

* Any memory instruction that has `rs1` as a base address register reads the full capability register (`cs1`) instead.
  The base address is unchanged, i.e., using the value from `rs1`.
  The metadata and {ctag} are used to <<sec_cap_checks,authorize the access>>.

* For a load instruction, the lower XLEN bits of the result written to the destination register is the same as in the RV32I/RV64I specification.

All load and store instructions authorized by `cs1` raise exceptions if any of these checks fail:

* `cs1` must not be `c0`^1^
* The {ctag} (`cs1.tag`) must be set
* `cs1` must be unsealed
ifdef::invalid_address_viol[]
* The virtual address in `cs1` must not be invalid if virtual memory is enabled.
endif::[]
* For loads, <<r_perm,read permission>> must be set in `cs1`
* For stores, <<w_perm,write permission>> must be set in `cs1`
* All <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks on `cs1` must pass

^1^ All load/store encodings are _reserved_ if `cs1=c0` (since dereferencing <<null-cap>> always faults).

All load instructions, except for the {cheri_base_ext_name} <<LC>>, always zero the {ctag} and metadata of the result register.

All store instructions, except for the {cheri_base_ext_name} <<SC>>, always write zero to the {ctag} or tags associated with the memory locations that are written to.

Therefore, misaligned stores may clear up to two associated {ctag} bits.

The changed interpretation of the base register also applies to all loads, stores and other memory operations defined in later chapters of this specification with a base operand of `rs1` unless stated otherwise.

*Under {cheri_base_ext_name} _all_ loads and stores are authorized by `cs1`.*

These rules affect the following <<rv32,base ISA>> instructions listed in <<tab_cap_base_summary>>, and also apply to instructions added by other extensions, e.g.,:

* Floating-point loads and stores
* <<section_cheri_vector_integration,Vector load and stores>>.
* Atomic memory accesses, see <<zaamo_cheri>> and <<zalrsc_cheri>>.

|=======================

==== Changes to PC

* Whenever the address field of the <<pcc>> is modified, it is _always_ updated using <<SCADDR>> semantics.
  This includes adding an offset to the <<pcc>> from direct jumps and branches for both the target address and the link register.
  In this case, e.g., `new_pcc = SCADDR(old_pcc, offset)`
* <<JALR_CHERI>> copies `cs1` into the <<pcc>>, and increments the address field with the offset.
  In this case, e.g., `new_pcc = SCADDR(cs1, offset)`

These rules affect the following <<rv32,base ISA>> instructions listed in <<tab_cap_base_summary>>, and also apply to instructions added by other extensions, e.g.,:
