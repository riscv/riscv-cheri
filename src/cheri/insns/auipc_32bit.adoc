#Begin changed since last ARC review#

Description::
Form a 32-bit offset from the 20-bit immediate filling the lowest bits with zero;
the number of places to shift is determined by the capability encoding's choice of
the <<section_auipc_shift>> value (12, unless otherwise specified).
Take the value of the AUIPC instruction's <<pcc>>, increment its address by the 32-bit offset using the semantics of the <<SCADDR>> instruction and write the result to `{cd}`.

[#section_auipc_shift,reftext="AUIPC shift"]
==== The AUIPC Shift

#Begin new since last ARC review#

The RISC-V base integer ISA frequently splits signed 32-bit constants
accross instructions as the addition of a signed 12-bit constant
and a 20-bit constant shifted left by 12 bits.
For example, the I-type instruction `ADDI`, with its 12-bit immediate,
is to be combined with the U-type `LUI` instruction and its 20-bit immediate
when values beyond the reach of a signed 12-bit value are needed.
To reach a given value in this way involve "overshooting" the desired value:
for example, to materialize `0xf01` (`3841`) into a register,
one uses `LUI` to materialize `0x1000` (`4096`)
and `ADDI` to _subtract_ `0xff` (`255`).
Similarly, the U-type `AUIPC` instruction, with its 20-bit immediate,
is designed to compose well with the signed 12-bit immediate operands
of load (I-type) and store (S-type) instructions.

When manipulating addresses within capabilities, there is a risk
that such two-step sequences could take the address out of bounds
before attempting to bring it back within bounds.
Many capability encodings, including those of the <<app_cap_description>>,
have a <<section_rep_check_concept,*representable range*>> sufficient
to ensure that any capability whose length is larger than 2 KiB
(that is, those for which a signed 12-bit displacement might be insufficient)
are able to represent at least 2 KiB on either side of their bounds.
However, this is not an *essential* property of capability encodings,
and so this specification allows the capability *encoding* to specify
the shift used within address-manipulating instructions with shifted immediates.
For <<AUIPC_CHERI>> specifically, we refer to this value as **the AUIPC shift**,
and take it to be 12 unless the capability encoding sets it to 11.
(Taking the shift to be 11 instead of 12 decreases the reach of `AUIPC`
from ±2 GiB to ±1 GiB, but ensures that all values within that range
can be obtained with the same sign bit in the `AUIPC` immediate
and subsequent 12-bit immediate(s),
thereby ensuring that in-bounds addresses can be reached without risk of
the intermediate computation exceeding capability bounds.)
Future extensions that add instructions with similar semantics
should make use this same encoding-specified shift value or
otherwise allow the capability encoding to set the shift amount.
