==== HLV.C

Synopsis::
Hypervisor virtual-machine load capability

Mnemonic::
`hlv.c cd, cs1`

//{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
//`hlv.c cd, rs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/hypv-virt-load-cap.adoc[]

Description::
Execute <<LC>> as though V=1; i.e., with the address
translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory accesses in
either VS-mode or VU-mode.
+
The effective address is `cs1.address`.
+
The authorizing capability for the operation is `cs1`.
+
The loaded value is written to `cd`.

//{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
//Load a CLEN-bit value from memory as though V=1; i.e., with the address
//translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory accesses in
//either VS-mode and VU-mode. The effective address is `rs1`. The authorizing
//capability for the operation is <<ddc>>. A copy of the loaded value is written
//to `cd`.
