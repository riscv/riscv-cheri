Synopsis::
{SCBNDS_DESC}

Mnemonics::
`{scbnds_lc} {cd}, {cs1}, rs2` +
`{scbndsi_lc} {cd}, {cs1}, uimm`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scbnds_32bit.adoc[]

Description::
Copy the capability from register `{cs1}` to register `{cd}`.
Set the base address of its bounds to the value of `{cs1}.address` and
set the length of its bounds to `rs2[XLEN-1:0]` for <<SCBNDS>>, or `imm` for <<SCBNDSI>>.
+
Set `{cd}.tag=0` if `{cs1}.tag=0`, `{cs1}` is sealed or if `{cd}` 's bounds exceed `{cs1}` 's bounds.
+
Set `{cd}.tag=0` if the requested bounds cannot be encoded exactly.
+
include::malformed_cs1_clear_tag.adoc[]
+
<<SCBNDSI>> uses the `s` bit to scale the immediate by 4 places
+
`immediate = ZeroExtend(s ? uimm<<4 : uimm)`

NOTE: The <<SCBNDSI>> encoding with `s=1` and `uimm â‰¤ 1` is RESERVED since these immediates can also be encoded with `s=0`.
