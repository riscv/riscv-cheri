Synopsis::
Set Capability Subset

Mnemonic::
`scss rd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scss.adoc[]

Description::
`rd` is set to 1 if:
. the valid tag of capabilities `cs1` and `cs2` are equal, and
. the bounds and permissions of `cs2` are a subset of those of `cs1`, and
. `cs2` 's <<section_cap_level>> is equal to or lower than `cs1` 's, and
. neither `cs1` or `cs2` fail any <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks

Otherwise set `rd` to 0.

NOTE: The implementation of this instruction is similar to <<CBLD>>, although
<<SCSS>> does not include the sealed bit in the check.

Operation::
