Exceptions::
ifdef::has_cap_data[]
Load access fault exception when the effective address is not aligned to CLEN/8.
+
CAUTION: #This is a change in behavior relative to v0.9.5 (previously a misaligned exception was raised)#
+
endif::[]
ifndef::has_cap_data[]
ifdef::load_res[]
All misaligned load reservations cause a load address misaligned exception to allow software emulation (if the Zam extension is supported, see cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec]), otherwise they take a load access fault exception.

#ARC suggestion: consider software check fault#

CHERI fault exception when one of the checks below fail (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):

[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]
|==============================================================================
| Kind                  | Reason
| Tag violation         | Authorizing capability valid tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| Seal violation        | Authorizing capability is sealed
| Permission violation  | Authorizing capability does not grant <<r_perm>>, or the <<AP-field>> could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
ifdef::invalid_address_viol[]
| Invalid address violation  | The effective address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
endif::[]
| Bounds violation      | At least one byte accessed is outside the authorizing capability bounds, or the capability has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds

// TODO: check that the priv spec defines all of this!
// If virtual memory is enabled on an RV64 hart, then the state of <<section_priv_cheri_vmem,PTE>>.CW,
// and, if {cheri_priv_crg_ext} is implemented, <<section_cheri_priv_crg_ext,PTE.CRG>>, <<section_cheri_priv_crg_ext,PTE>>.U and <<sstatusreg_pte,sstatus>>.UCRG,
// may cause a <<section_priv_cheri_vmem,CHERI PTE load page fault>> exception in addition to a normal RISC-V page fault exception.
// See <<mtval2-page-fault>> for the exception reporting in this case.
