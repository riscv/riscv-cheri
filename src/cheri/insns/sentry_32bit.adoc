// Omit this note for ISA manual integration, CHERIoT-specific
NOTE: The <<SENTRY>> instruction may give rise to an illegal instruction fault
when the implementation does not support capability type 1 (unrestricted
sentry; see xref:sec_cap_type[xrefstyle=short]).
This is not the case when the implementation supports the capability encoding described in xref:app_cap_description[xrefstyle=short].
