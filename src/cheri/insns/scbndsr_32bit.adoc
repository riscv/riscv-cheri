`scbndsr yd, ys1, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scbndsr_32bit.adoc[]

Description::
Capability register `yd`  is set to capability register `ys1`  with the base
address of its bounds replaced with the value of `ys1.address` field and
the length of its bounds set to `rs2`. The base is rounded down
and the top is rounded up by the smallest amounts needed to form a representable
capability covering the requested base and top. In all cases, `yd.tag` is set to 0
if its bounds exceed `ys1` 's bounds, `ys1` 's tag is 0 or `ys1`  is sealed.
