Synopsis::
{SCBNDSR_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`{scbndsr_lc} {cd}, {cs1}, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scbndsr_32bit.adoc[]

Description::
Copy the capability from register `{cs1}` to register `{cd}.
Set the base address of its bounds to the value of `{cs1}.address` and
set the length of its bounds to `rs2[XLEN-1:0]`.
+
The base is rounded down
and the top is rounded up by the smallest amounts needed to form a
capability covering the requested base and top.
+
Set `{cd}.tag=0` if `{cs1}.tag=0`, `{cs1}` is sealed or if `{cd}` 's bounds exceed `{cs1}` 's bounds.
+
Set `{cd}.tag=0` if the requested bounds cannot be encoded exactly.
