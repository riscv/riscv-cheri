Synopsis::
Capability set bounds, rounding up if necessary

Mnemonic::
`scbndsr cd, cs1, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scbndsr_32bit.adoc[]

Description::
Capability register `cd` is set to capability register `cs1`  with the base
address of its bounds replaced with the value of `cs1.address` and
the length of its bounds set to `rs2`.
+
The base is rounded down
and the top is rounded up by the smallest amounts needed to form a
capability covering the requested base and top.
+
Set `cd.tag=0` if `cs1.tag=0`, `cs1` is sealed or if `cd` 's bounds exceed `cs1` 's bounds.
+
Set `cd.tag=0` if the requested bounds cannot be encoded exactly.
