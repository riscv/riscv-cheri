Synopsis::
Capability build

Mnemonic::
`cbld cd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cbld.adoc[]

Description::
Copy `cs2` to `cd`.
+
Set `cd.tag=1` if:
+
. `cs1.tag` is set, and
. `cs1` passes all <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks, and
. `cs1` is not sealed, and
. `cs2` 's permissions and bounds are equal to or a subset of `cs1` 's, and
. `cs2` 's <<section_cap_level>> is equal to or lower than `cs1` 's, and
. `cs2` passes all <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks
+
Otherwise, set `cd.tag=0`

NOTE: <<CBLD>> is typically used alongside <<SCHI>> to build
capabilities from integer values.

NOTE: When `cs1` is `c0` CBLD will copy `cs2` to `cd` and clear `cd.tag`.
However future extensions may add additional behavior to update currently reserved fields,
and so software should not assume `cs1==0` to be a pseudo-instruction for tag clearing.

Operation::
+
sail::execute[clause="CBLD(_, _, _)",part=body,unindent]
