==== BEQ, BNE, BLT[U], BGE[U] ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Conditional branches (BEQ, BNE, BLT[U], BGE[U])

Mnemonics::
`beq rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bne rs1, rs2, imm` +
`blt rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bge rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bltu rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bgeu rs1, rs2, imm`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-conditional.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: For `beq` and `bne` only, if `rs1â‰¥rs2` then the encoding is RESERVED. These encodings are redundant and may be used by future extensions.

NOTE: Future branch behavior may include branching on {ctag} values only, or CLEN-bit compares.

Description::
Execute as defined in the base ISA.
If taken, the <<pcc>> is incremented by the offset using <<SCADDR>> semantics.

NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the branch instruction itself if fetching a minimum sized instruction at the target <<pcc>> will raise a _{cheri_excep_name_pc}_.
