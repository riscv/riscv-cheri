Permissions::
ifdef::cap_atomic[]
Requires the authorizing capability have its {ctag} set and not be sealed.
+
Requires <<r_perm>> and <<w_perm>> in the authorizing capability.
+
If <<c_perm>> is not granted then store the memory tag as zero, and load `cd.tag` as zero.
+
If the authorizing capability does not grant <<lm_perm>>, and the {ctag} of `cd` is 1 and `cd` is not sealed, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> clearing <<w_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> is performed to obtain the intermediate permissions on `cd` (see <<LOAD_CAP>>).
+
Extensions may further (monotonically) modify loaded or stored capabilities via "implicit <<ACPERM>>-s" and/or outright tag clearing;
see <<LOAD_CAP>> and <<STORE_CAP>>.
+
endif::[]
ifndef::cap_atomic[]
Requires <<r_perm>> and <<w_perm>> in the authorizing capability.
endif::[]
+
Requires all bytes of the access to be in capability bounds.

Exceptions::
ifdef::cap_atomic[]
Store/AMO access fault exception when the effective address is not aligned to YLEN/8.
+
CAUTION: #This is a change in behavior relative to v0.9.5 (previously a misaligned exception was raised)#
+
Store/AMO access fault if the stored {ctag} is set to one and the PMA is _CHERI {ctag_title} Fault_.
endif::[]
ifndef::cap_atomic[]
If the address is not naturally aligned raise a _Store/AMO address misaligned_ exception or a _Store/AMO access fault_ exception. See <<sec:amo,"Zaamo">> for details on which one is raised.
endif::[]
+
_CHERI data fault_ exceptions occur when the authorizing capability fails one of the checks
listed below (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):
