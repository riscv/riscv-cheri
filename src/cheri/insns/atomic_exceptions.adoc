Permissions::
ifdef::cap_atomic[]
Requires the authorizing capability have its {ctag} set and not be sealed.
+
Requires <<r_perm>> and <<w_perm>> in the authorizing capability.
+
If <<c_perm>> is not granted then store the memory tag as zero, and load `cd.tag` as zero.
+
If the authorizing capability does not grant <<lm_perm>>, and the {ctag} of `cd` is 1 and `cd` is not sealed, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> clearing <<w_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> is performed to obtain the intermediate permissions on `cd` (see <<LOAD_CAP>>).
+
If the authorizing capability does not grant <<el_perm>>, and the {ctag} of `cd` is 1, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> restricting the <<section_cap_level>> to the level of the authorizing capability is performed.
If `cd` is not sealed, this implicit <<ACPERM>> also clears <<el_perm>> to obtain the final permissions on `cd` (see <<cap_level_load_summary>> and <<LOAD_CAP>>).
+
The stored tag is also set to zero if the authorizing capability does not have <<sl_perm>> set but the stored data has a <<section_cap_level>> of 0 (see <<STORE_CAP>>).
endif::[]
ifndef::cap_atomic[]
Requires <<r_perm>> and <<w_perm>> in the authorizing capability.
endif::[]
+
Requires all bytes of the access to be in capability bounds.

Exceptions::
All misaligned atomics cause a store/AMO address misaligned exception to allow software emulation (if the Zam extension is supported, see cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec]), otherwise they take a store/AMO access fault exception.
+
_CHERI data fault_ exceptions occur when the authorizing capability fails one of the checks
listed below (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):
