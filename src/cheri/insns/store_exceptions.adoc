Exceptions::
ifdef::store_cond[]
All misaligned store conditionals cause a store/AMO address misaligned exception to allow software emulation (if the Zam extension is supported, see cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec]), otherwise they take a store/AMO access fault exception.
+
endif::[]
ifdef::has_cap_data[]
Misaligned address fault exception when the effective address is not aligned
to CLEN/8.
+
endif::[]
_CHERI data fault_ exceptions occur when the authorizing capability fails one of the checks
listed below (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):

[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]
|==============================================================================
| Kind                  | Reason
| Tag violation         | Authorizing capability valid tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| Seal violation        | Authorizing capability is sealed
| Permission violation  | Authorizing capability does not grant <<w_perm>>, or the AP field could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
| Invalid address violation  | The effective address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
| Bounds violation      | At least one byte accessed is outside the authorizing capability bounds, or the capability has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds
|==============================================================================

// TODO: check that the priv spec defines all of this!
// If virtual memory is enabled on an RV64 hart, then the state of <<section_priv_cheri_vmem,PTE>>.CW,
// and, if {cheri_priv_crg_ext} is implemented, <<section_cheri_priv_crg_ext,PTE.CRG>> from the current virtual memory page may
// cause a <<section_priv_cheri_vmem,CHERI PTE store/AMO page fault>> exception in addition to a normal RISC-V page fault
// when operating in user mode.
// See <<mtval2-page-fault>> for the exception reporting in this case.
