Synopsis::
{GCTYPE_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`{gctype_lc} rd, {cs1}`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gctype.adoc[]

Description::
Decode the architectural capability type (<<sec_cap_type>>) from `{cs1}` and write the result to `rd`.
+
include::no_tag_affect.adoc[]
+
// NOTE: While the architectural capability type maps directly to the value of the `CT` capability bit in {cheri_base_ext_name}, future extensions may define an alternate mapping.
// Therefore, software should always use <<GCTYPE>> to obtain the capability type rather than directly reading the high bits of the capability using <<GCHI>>.
