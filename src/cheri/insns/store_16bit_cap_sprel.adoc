==== C.SYSP

Synopsis::
Capability stores (C.SY, C.SYSP), 16-bit encodings

include::xlen_variable_warning.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonics::
`c.sy cs2', offset(cs1')` +
`c.sy cs2', offset(ysp)`

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Expansions::
`sy cs2', offset(cs1')` +
`sy cs2', offset(ysp)`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/c-sp-store-cap.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Store the YLEN-bit value in `cs2'` to memory. The capability in `cs1/ysp`
authorizes the operation. The effective address of the memory access is
obtained by adding the address of `cs1/ysp` to the zero-extended offset.

NOTE: These mnemonics do not exist in {cheri_int_mode_name}.

Tag of the written capability value::

The capability written to memory has the {ctag} set to 0 if the {ctag} of `cs2'` is 0 or if the authorizing capability (`cs1/ysp`) does not grant <<c_perm>>.
+
The stored tag is also set to zero if the authorizing capability does not have <<sl_perm>> set but the stored data has a <<section_cap_level>> of 0 (_local_).
