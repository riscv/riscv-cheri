Synopsis::
Capability pointer increment

Mnemonic::
`cadd cd, cs1, rs2` +
`caddi cd, cs1, imm`

Suggested assembly syntax::
`add cd, cs1, rs2` +
`add cd, cs1, imm`

NOTE: The suggested assembly syntax distinguishes from integer `add` by operand type.

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cadd.adoc[]

NOTE: <<CADD>> with `rs2=x0` is decoded as <<CMV>> instead, the key
difference being that capabilities cannot have their valid tag
cleared by <<CMV>>.

Description::
Increment the address field of the capability `cs1`  and write the result to ``cd``.
Set `cd.tag=0` if `cs1.tag=0` or `cs1` is sealed.
+
For <<CADD>>, the address is incremented by the value in `rs2` . +
For <<CADDI>>, the address is incremented by the immediate value `imm`.
