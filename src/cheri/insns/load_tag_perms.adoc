Determining the final value of `cd`::
If the valid tag of the memory location loaded is 0, or the authorizing capability (`cs1`) does not grant <<c_perm>> then set `cd.tag=0`. In this case the steps below do not apply.
+
If `cd.tag=1`, `cd` is not sealed and `cs1` does not grant <<lm_perm>>, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> is performed to clear <<w_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> from `cd`.
+
If `cd.tag=1`, `cd` is not sealed and `cs1` does not grant <<el_perm>>, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> is performed restricting the <<section_cap_level>> of `cd` to the level of `cs1` and to remove <<el_perm>>.
+
If `cd.tag=1`, `cd` is sealed and `cs1` does not grant <<el_perm>>, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> is performed restricting the <<section_cap_level>> of `cd` to the level of `cs1`
+
If {cheri_1levels_ext_name} is implemented, then also see <<cap_level_load_summary>>.
+
NOTE: Missing <<el_perm>> also affects the level of sealed capabilities since notionally the <<section_cap_level>> of a capability is not a permission but rather a data flow label attached to the loaded value.
+
NOTE: While the implicit <<ACPERM>> introduces a dependency on the loaded data, implementations can avoid this by deferring the actual masking of permissions until the loaded capability is dereferenced or the metadata bits are inspected using <<GCPERM>> or <<GCHI>>. Additionally, metadata modifications  are on naturally aligned data, and so on the read path from a data cache, the modification typically happens in parallel with data alignment multiplexers.
+
#ARC feedback: this is change relative to 0.9.5 so that the choice is removed. Choosing the other option would need to be a future extension#
+
When sending load data to a trace interface, implementations trace the final value written to `cd` which may not match the value in memory.
