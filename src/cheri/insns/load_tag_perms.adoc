Resulting value of `cd`::
The validity tag value written to `cd` is 0 if the validity tag of the memory location loaded is
0 or the authorizing capability (<<ddc>> or `cs1`) does not grant <<c_perm>>.
+
If the authorizing capability does not grant <<lm_perm>>, and the validity tag of `cd` is 1 and `cd` is not sealed, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> clearing <<w_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> is performed to obtain the intermediate permissions on `cd`.
+
If the authorizing capability does not grant <<el_perm>>, and the validity tag of `cd` is 1, then an implicit <<ACPERM>> restricting the <<section_cap_level>> to the level of the authorizing capability is performed.
If `cd` is not sealed, this implicit <<ACPERM>> also clears <<el_perm>> to obtain the final permissions on `cd` (see <<cap_level_load_summary>>).

NOTE: Missing <<lm_perm>> does not affect untagged values since this could result in surprising bit patterns when copying non-capability data.
Similarly, sealed capabilities are not modified as they are not directly dereferenceable.

NOTE: Missing <<el_perm>> also affects the level of sealed capabilities since notionally the <<section_cap_level>> of a capability is not a permission but rather a data flow label attached to the loaded value.
However, untagged values are not affected by <<el_perm>>.

NOTE: While the implicit <<ACPERM>> introduces a dependency on the loaded data, implementations can avoid this by deferring the actual masking of permissions until the loaded capability is dereferenced or the metadata bits are inspected using <<GCPERM>> or <<GCHI>>.

NOTE: When sending load data to a trace interface implementations can choose whether to trace the value before or after <<ACPERM>> has modified the data. The recommendation is to trace the value after <<ACPERM>>.
