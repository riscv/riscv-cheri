Description::
A PREFETCH.I instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `{cs1}` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by an instruction fetch in the near future. The encoding
is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorizing capability for this operation is
`{cs1}`. This instruction does not throw any exceptions. However, following
the rules from xref:rv32y[xrefstyle=short], this instruction does not perform a prefetch
if it is not authorized by `{cs1}`.
