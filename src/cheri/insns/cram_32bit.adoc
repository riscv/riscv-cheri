Synopsis::
Get Capability Representable Alignment Mask ({CRAM})

Mnemonic::
`{cram_lc} rd, rs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cram.adoc[]

Description::
Integer register `rd` is set to a mask that can be used to round addresses down to a value that is sufficiently aligned to set exact bounds for the nearest representable length of `rs1`.
See <<section_cap_bounds>> for the algorithm used to compute the next representable length.

Operation::
+
sail::execute[clause="CRAM(_, _)",part=body,unindent]
