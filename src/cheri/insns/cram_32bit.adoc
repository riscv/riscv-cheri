==== {CRAM}

Synopsis::
{CRAM_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`{cram_lc} rd, rs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cram.adoc[]

Description::
`rd[XLEN-1:0]` is set to a mask that can be used to round addresses down to a value that is sufficiently aligned to set exact bounds for the nearest representable length of `rs1[XLEN-1:0]`.
The upper bits of `rd` are zero extended.
See <<section_cap_bounds>> for the algorithm used to compute the next representable length.

Operation::
+
sail::execute[clause="CRAM(_, _)",part=body,unindent]
