Synopsis::
{GCPERM_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`{gcperm_lc} rd, {creg_pref}s1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gcperm.adoc[]

Description::
Convert the unpacked <<AP-field>>, <<SDP-field>>, and any other extension-defined permission-like fields of capability `{creg_pref}s1`
into a bit field, with the same format as used by <<CLRPERM>> (see <<acperm_bit_field>>),
and write the result to `rd`.
+
All bits in the `[23:0]` range that are reserved or assigned to extensions that are not implemented by the current hart always report 1.
+
All architectural permission bits in `rd` are set to 0 if any <<section_cap_integrity,integrity>> checks failed.
