Synopsis::
Capability get permissions

Mnemonic::
`gcperm rd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gcperm.adoc[]

Description::
If MXLEN=32 unpack permissions from the format in <<cap_perms_encoding32>>.
+
Convert the unpacked AP permissions as well as the SDP fields of capability `cs1`
into a bit field, with the format shown in xref:gcperm_bit_field[xrefstyle=short],
and write the result to `rd`. A bit set to 1 in the bit field indicates that
`cs1` grants the corresponding permission.
All bits in the `[0:23]` range that are reserved or assigned to extensions that are not implemented by the current hart always report 1.
+
If the AP field cannot be produced by <<ACPERM>> then all architectural
permission bits in `rd` are set to 0.

NOTE: When {cheri_0levels_ext_name} is implemented, the `CL`, `SL`, and `EL` fields always report 1.
This ensures forwards-compatibility with {cheri_1levels_ext_name} since loads/stores on a core without dynamic levels behave as if these permissions are always present.

NOTE: Any future extension that defines new permission that are a refinement of existing permissions (e.g. finer-grained <<asr_perm>>) must be allocated to the bits that are currently reported as 1 to ensure forward-compatibility.
Completely new permissions (e.g. sealing) should use the bits that are reported as zero in the current specification.
