==== PREFETCH.R ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Provide a HINT to hardware that a cache block is likely to be accessed by a
data read in the near future

Mnemonic::
`prefetch.r offset({creg_pref}s1)`

//{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
//`prefetch.r offset(rs1)`

Description::
A PREFETCH.R instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `{creg_pref}s1` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by a data read (i.e., load) in the near future. The
encoding is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorizing capability for this
operation is `{creg_pref}s1`. This instruction does not throw any exceptions. However,
following the rules from xref:rv32y[xrefstyle=short], this instruction does not
perform a prefetch if it is not authorized by `{creg_pref}s1`.
