Description::
Indirect jump to the target capability in `{cs1}` with an address offset.
+
Operationally, copy `{cs1}` to the target <<pcc>> and then...
+
. Compute the target <<pcc>> address in two steps, each using the semantics of the <<SCADDR>> instruction:
.. Increment the address of the target <<pcc>> by the sign-extended 12-bit `offset`, and
.. set the zero bit of the target <<pcc>> address to zero.
. Clear the {ctag} of the target <<pcc>> if the triple of its <<sec_cap_type>> value, `{cd}`, and `{cs1}` is not acceptable, as defined by the capability encoding.
+
NOTE: All such triples are acceptable to the <<app_cap_description>>.
. If the target <<pcc>> is a <<sentry_cap>> (for the <<app_cap_description>>: if it has <<sec_cap_type>> `1`), then unseal it.
. If the target <<pcc>> is (still) sealed, clear its {ctag}.
+
NOTE: This is not possible for the <<app_cap_description>>, given its two <<sec_cap_type>> values.
. If `{cd}â‰ 0`, compute the return capability and install it to `{cd}`:
.. add the width of this instruction to the current <<pcc>>, and
.. if the capability encoding defines <<sentry_cap>> <<sec_cap_type>> values for return pointers, then seal the return capability as specified.
+
NOTE: The <<app_cap_description>> always seals return capabilities with <<sec_cap_type>> `1`.
. Jump to the target <<pcc>>.
+
NOTE: It is not possible for the target <<pcc>> to be sealed by the time it is jumped to.
. Apply any capability encoding specified architectural semantics for the type of `{cs1}`.
+
NOTE: There are no such additional semantics defined by the capabilities of the <<app_cap_description>>. +

+
The above procedure for <<JALR_CHERI>> defines three hooks for use by the capability encoding:

1. Architectural interpretation of zero or more particular <<sec_cap_type>> values when a capability is passed as the input to <<JALR_CHERI>>.
   These <<sec_cap_type>> values are, by definition, <<sentry_cap>> types.
   The "architectural interpretation" for these capabilities necessary includes unsealing as part of installation but may include other effects as well.
+
NOTE: For example, CHERIoT offers sentries that update a hart's `mstatus.MIE` field when invoked.

2. A subset of those <<sec_cap_type>> values for use by <<JALR_CHERI>> to seal the return capability installed in the link register.
   A sentry return capability grants the right to return exactly to the instruction after the caller's call without relative offset.
   Moreover, a sentry return capability does not grant the callee access to the memory pointed to by the caller's <<pcc>>.

3. Conditional acceptability of the triple of the two _register selectors_ (`{cd}`, `{cs1}`) used in an instance of the instruction together with the <<sec_cap_type>> value of the capability in `{cs1}`.
+
NOTE: For the <<app_cap_description>>, there are no conditions and all such triples are acceptable;
again the motivation is CHERIoT, which uses register selectors to distinguish between _forward_ and _backward_ control transfers, and restricts which <<sec_cap_type>> values are acceptable in each case.

[NOTE]
=====
When a sealed capability is passed as the input to <<JALR_CHERI>>, its address must have bit zero clear and the instruction must have a zero offset, or the target <<pcc>> will have its {ctag} set to zero, since updates to its address are interpreted with <<SCADDR>> semantics.
=====

NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the JALR instruction itself if the target <<pcc>> will raise a {cheri_excep_name_pc} at the target.
