==== JALR ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link register

Mnemonic::
`jalr cd, cs1, offset`

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jalr rd, rs1, offset`
endif::[]

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional-2.adoc[]

include::base_isa_extension.adoc[]

Description::
JALR allows unconditional, indirect jumps to a target capability in `cs1`.
The target capability is unsealed if the `offset` is zero.
The target address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit `offset` to `cs1.address`, then setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction following the jump is sealed and written to `cd`.

// {cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
// JALR allows unconditional, indirect jumps to a target address. The target
// address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to `rs1`, then
// setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero. The target address
// is installed in the address field of the <<pcc>> which may require
// xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short].
// The address of the
// instruction following the jump is written to `rd`.

Exceptions::
A minimum sized instruction at the target address is not in `cs1` bounds. +
`cs1` is not suitable for installation into <<pcc>>.
See <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details.

// | CAUSE                 | {cheri_int_mode_name} | {cheri_cap_mode_name} | Reason
// | Tag violation         |      | ✔     | `cs1` has tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
// | Seal violation        |      | ✔     | `cs1` is sealed and the immediate is not 0
// | Permission violation  |      | ✔     | `cs1` does not grant <<x_perm>>, or the AP field could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
// | Invalid address violation  | ✔    | ✔     | The target address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
// | Bounds violation      | ✔    | ✔     | Minimum length instruction is not within the target capability's bounds, which will fail
// if `cs1` has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds in {cheri_cap_mode_name}.
