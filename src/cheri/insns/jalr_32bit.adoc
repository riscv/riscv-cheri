Synopsis::
{JAL_CHERI_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`jalr {cd}, {cs1}, offset`

Description::
Indirect jump to the target capability in `{cs1}` with an address offset.
+
Copy `{cs1}` to the target <<pcc>>
+
. If the target <<pcc>> is a sentry, and the `offset` is zero, then unseal the target <<pcc>>.
Otherwise, increment the address of the target <<pcc>> by the sign-extended 12-bit `offset`.
. Set bit zero of the target address to zero and update <<pcc>> with the new target address using <<SCADDR>> semantics
. Jump to the target <<pcc>>
+
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction is calculated using <<SCADDR>> semantics, and written to `{cd}` as a sentry.
+
NOTE: Because of the unsealing and <<SCADDR>> behavior, it is not possible for the target <<pcc>> to be sealed.
+
NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the JALR instruction itself if the target <<pcc>> will raise a CHERI exception at the target.
