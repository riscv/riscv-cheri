==== JALR ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link register

Mnemonic::
`jalr cd, cs1, offset`

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jalr rd, rs1, offset`
endif::[]

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional-2.adoc[]

include::base_isa_extension.adoc[]

Description::
Jump to the target capability in `cs1`.
+
The target capability is unsealed if the `offset` is zero.
Increment `cs1.address` by the sign-extended 12-bit `offset` and set the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction is sealed and written to `cd`.

Exceptions::
[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]
|==============================================================================
| Kind                  | Reason
| Tag violation         | `cs1` has tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| Seal violation        | `cs1` is sealed and the immediate is not 0
| Permission violation  | `cs1` does not grant <<x_perm>>, or the <<AP-field>> could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
ifdef::invalid_address_viol[]
| Invalid address violation | The target address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
endif::[]
| Bounds violation      | Minimum length instruction at the target is not within the target capability's bounds
|==============================================================================
