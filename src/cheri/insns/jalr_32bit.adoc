==== JALR ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link register

Mnemonic::
`jalr cd, cs1, offset`

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jalr rd, rs1, offset`
endif::[]

Encoding::

Description::
Indirect jump to the target capability in `cs1` with an address offset.
+
Copy `cs1` to the target <<pcc>>
+
. If the target <<pcc>> is a sentry, and the `offset` is zero, then unseal the target <<pcc>>.
. Set bit zero of the `offset` to zero.
. Increment the address of the target <<pcc>> by the sign-extended 12-bit `offset` using <<SCADDR>> semantics.
. Jump to the target <<pcc>>
+
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction is calculated using <<SCADDR>> semantics, sealed and written to `cd`.
+
NOTE: Because of the unsealing and <<SCADDR>> behavior, it is not possible for the target <<pcc>> to be sealed.
+
NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the JALR instruction itself if the target <<pcc>> will raise a CHERI exception at the target.
