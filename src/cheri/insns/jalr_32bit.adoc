==== JALR ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
{JALR_CHERI_DESC}

Mnemonic::
`jalr {cd}, {cs1}, offset`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional-2.adoc[]

include::base_isa_extension.adoc[]

Description::
Indirect jump to the target capability in `{cs1}` with an address offset.
+
Copy `{cs1}` to the target <<pcc>>
+
. Increment the address of the target <<pcc>> by the sign-extended 12-bit `offset`.
. Set bit zero of the target address to zero and update <<pcc>> with the new target address using the semantics of the <<SCADDR>> instruction
. Jump to the target <<pcc>>
+
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction is calculated using the semantics of the <<SCADDR>> instruction.
+
NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the JALR instruction itself if the target <<pcc>> will raise a CHERI exception at the target.
