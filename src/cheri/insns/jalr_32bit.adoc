==== JALR ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link register

Mnemonic::
`jalr yd, ys1, offset`

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jalr rd, rs1, offset`
endif::[]

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional-2.adoc[]

include::base_isa_extension.adoc[]

Description::
JALR allows unconditional, indirect jumps to a target capability in `ys1`.
The target capability is unsealed if the `offset` is zero.
The target address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit `offset` to `ys1.address`, then setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction following the jump is sealed and written to `yd`.

// {cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
// JALR allows unconditional, indirect jumps to a target address. The target
// address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to `rs1`, then
// setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero. The target address
// is installed in the address field of the <<pcc>> which may require
// xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short].
// The address of the
// instruction following the jump is written to `rd`.

Exceptions::
CHERI fault exception when one of the checks below fail (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):

[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]
|==============================================================================
| Kind                  | Reason
| Tag violation         | `ys1` has tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| Seal violation        | `ys1` is sealed and the immediate is not 0
| Permission violation  | `ys1` does not grant <<x_perm>>, or the AP field could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
| Invalid address violation | The target address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
| Bounds violation      | Minimum length instruction is not within the target capability's bounds
