Synopsis::
Integer Stores (SD, SW, SH, SB)

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonics::
`sd rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sw rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sh rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sb rs2, offset(cs1)`

Description::
Store integer data of the indicated size (byte, halfword, word, double-word) to memory.
The effective address of the store is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit offset to the address of `cs1`.
The authorizing capability for the operation is `cs1`.
A copy of `rs2` is written to memory at the location indicated by the effective address and the validity tag bit of each block of memory naturally aligned to CLEN/8 is cleared.
