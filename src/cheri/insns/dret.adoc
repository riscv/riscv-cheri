==== DRET ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Debug Return (DRET)

Mnemonic::
`dret`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/dret.adoc[]

Description::
<<DRET_CHERI>> return from debug mode. It unseals <<dpcc>> and writes the result into
<<pcc>>.

NOTE: The <<DRET_CHERI>> instruction is the recommended way to exit debug mode. However,
it is a pseudoinstruction to return that technically does not execute from the
program buffer or memory. It currently does not require the <<pcc>> to grant
<<asr_perm>> so it never excepts.

Prerequisites::
Sdext

Operation::
