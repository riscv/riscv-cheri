Exceptions::
#ARC suggestion: consider software check fault#
+
_CHERI data fault_ exceptions occur when the authorizing capability fails one of the checks
listed below (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):

|==============================================================================
| Kind                   | Reason
| {cheri_excep_name_tag} | Authorizing capability valid tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| {cheri_excep_name_seal}| Authorizing capability is sealed

ifdef::cbo_clean_flush[]
| {cheri_excep_name_perm}| Authorizing capability does not grant <<w_perm>>, or does not grant <<r_perm>>, or the <<AP-field>> could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>

ifdef::cbo_inval[]
| {cheri_excep_name_perm}| Authorizing capability does not grant <<w_perm>>, or does not grant <<r_perm>> or does not grant <<asr_perm>>, or the <<AP-field>> could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
endif::[]
ifdef::invalid_address_viol[]
| {cheri_excep_cause_inv_addr}| The effective address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
endif::invalid_address_viol[]
ifdef::cbo_clean_flush[]
| {cheri_excep_cause_bounds} | None of the bytes accessed are within the bounds, or the capability has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds
endif::cbo_clean_flush[]
ifdef::cbo_inval[]
| {cheri_excep_cause_bounds} | At least one byte accessed is outside the authorizing capability bounds, or the capability has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds
endif::cbo_inval[]

ifdef::cbo_inval[]
CSR state controls whether CBO.INVAL performs cache block flushes instead of invalidations for less privileged modes.

NOTE: Invalidating a cache block can re-expose capabilities previously stored
to it after the most recent flush, not just secret values. As such, CBO.INVAL
has stricter checks on its use than CBO.FLUSH, and should only be made available to,
and used by, sufficiently-trusted software. Untrusted software should use CBO.FLUSH
instead.
