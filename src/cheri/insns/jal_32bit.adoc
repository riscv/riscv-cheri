[#JAL_CHERI,reftext="JAL ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== JAL ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link

Mnemonic::
`jal cd, offset`

//{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
//`jal rd, offset`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional.adoc[]

Description::
JAL's immediate encodes a signed offset in multiple of 2 bytes. The <<pcc>> is
incremented by the sign-extended offset to form the jump target capability. The
target capability is written to <<pcc>>. The <<pcc>> of the next instruction
following the jump is sealed and written to `cd`.

//{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
//JAL's immediate encodes a signed offset in multiple of 2 bytes. The
//sign-extended offset is added to the <<pcc>>'s address to form the target
//address which is written to the <<pcc>>'s address field. The address of the
//instruction following the jump is written to `rd`.

Exceptions::
CHERI fault exception when one of the checks below fail (see <<sec_cheri_exception_handling,_CHERI Exception handling_ in the privileged specification>> for further details):
+
[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]
|==============================================================================
| Kind                      | Reason
| Invalid address violation  | The target address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
| Bounds violation           | Minimum length instruction is not within the <<pcc>>'s bounds.
