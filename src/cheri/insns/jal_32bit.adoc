[#JAL_CHERI,reftext="JAL ({cheri_base_ext_name})"]
==== JAL ({cheri_base_ext_name})

Synopsis::
Jump and link

Mnemonic::
`jal cd, offset`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional.adoc[]

Description::
Jump to the target <<pcc>>.
+
Increment <<pcc>>.address by the sign-extended offset to form the target <<pcc>>.
The <<pcc>> of the next instruction is sealed and written to `cd`.
+
Both address increments use <<SCADDR>> semantics to determine the result.

NOTE: A future extension may raise an exception on the branch instruction itself if fetching a minimum sized instruction at the target <<pcc>> will raise a CHERI bounds exception.
  Peforming the <<pcc>> bounds check at the branch source instead of on instruction fetch is helpful for debugging and can simplify the implementation of CPUs with very short pipelines.
  

Operation::
+
TODO

//commented out as it still has exception checks
//sail::execute[clause="JAL_capmode(_, _)",part=body,unindent]
