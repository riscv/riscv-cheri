== The {rvy64_uni_base_name} Capability Base Extension for {cheri_base64_ext_name}, Version 1.0

This chapter describes the in-memory format and properties of the capability encoding intended for {cheri_base64_ext_name}.

[#section_cap_encoding]
=== Capability Encoding

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The encoding changes eliminate the concept of the in-memory format.
endif::[]

The components of a capability, except the {ctag}, are encoded as shown in xref:cap_encoding_xlen64[xrefstyle=short].
Each memory location or register able to hold a capability must also store the {ctag} as _out of band_ or _hidden_ information that software cannot directly set or clear.
The capability metadata is held in the most significant bits and the address is held in the least significant bits.

.Capability encoding for {rvy64_uni_base_name}
[#cap_encoding_xlen64]
include::img/cap-encoding-xlen64.edn[]

NOTE: Reserved bits must be 0 in valid capabilities and are available for future extensions to {cheri_base_ext_name}.

The encoding diagram above shows the format of capabilities in the case where all {cheri_base_ext_name} (Zy*) extensions listed in this manual are supported.
Certain bits of the capability encoding are only used if certain extensions are implemented and are reserved otherwise:

<<section_cheri_hybrid_ext>>::
When {cheri_default_ext_name} is supported, capabilities include an <<m_bit>> (bit 52).
If not supported the <<m_bit>> is reserved and reads as zero.

<<section_zylevels1>>::
If <<section_zylevels1>> is available, bits 6 and 7 of the `AP` field are allocated, otherwise they must always be set to `1` for any valid capability.
Additionally, the <<zylevels1_gl_perm,GL>> flag is only available if <<section_zylevels1>> is implemented, otherwise it is reserved and must be zero.


This capability encoding has the following properties that affect the observable behavior of {cheri_base_ext_name} instructions such as <<SCBNDS>> and <<CLRPERM>>:

* **Mantissa width (mw{cap_rv64_mw_width})**: The mantissa width for the bounds encoding uses {cap_rv64_mw_width} bits
* **Maximum exponent (e{cap_rv64_exp_max})**: The maximum value for the exponent in a valid capability is {cap_rv64_exp_max}.
* **Representable region (rc1)**: The encoding uses one additional bit to ensure a _centered_ region of at least 1/4 of the capability size remains representable when creating out-of-bounds derived capabilities.
* **Permission encoding (ps)**: The permissions are encoded using a simple representation of one bit per architectural permission.

|==============================================================================

[#AP-field-encoding64, reftext="AP-field encoding"]
==== Architectural Permissions (AP) Encoding

The permissions field is {cap_rv64_perms_width} bits wide and is encoded using one bit per architectural permission as shown in xref:cap_perms_encoding64[xrefstyle=short].
A permission is granted if its corresponding bit, and those of any dependent permissions, are set;
otherwise, the capability does not grant that permission.
Certain combinations of permissions are impractical. For example, <<c_perm>> is superfluous when the capability does not grant either <<r_perm>> or <<w_perm>>.
Therefore, it is only legal to encode a subset of all combinations, but this capability encoding does not make use of this redundancy as there are sufficient reserved bits.

NOTE: In the future, if there are no further remaining reserved bits, but extensions need to allocate further capability metadata bits, it will be possible to use the redundancy to create a future version two of this encoding that is fully _compatible for all software_ but with observable differences in the in-memory representation of capabilities.

NOTE: Future extensions may define new permissions and, if so, must augment the above table.

[#M-field-encoding64, reftext="M-field encoding"]
==== Capability Mode (M) Encoding

The <<m_bit>> is only assigned meaning when the implementation supports {cheri_default_ext_name} _and_ <<x_perm>> is set.
In valid capabilities, the bit assigned to the <<m_bit>> must be zero if <<x_perm>> isn't set.

[#SDP-field64, reftext="SDP-field"]
==== Software-Defined Permissions (SDP) Encoding

The <<SDP-field64>> is {cap_rv64_sdp_width} bits wide.
The value of the <<SDP-field64>> bits of the <<GCPERM>> result maps 1:1 to the <<SDP-field64>> in the capability.

NOTE: Software is completely free to define the usage of these bits.

[#section_cap_sealed]
==== Capability Type (CT) Encoding

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
WARNING: *CHERI v9:* There is now a 1-bit otype (sentry or unsealed) and the old CHERI v9 otype no longer exists.
The base CHERI-RISC-V standard does not have support for CHERI v9 CSEAL for sealed capabilities with object types and only has <<SENTRY>> for sealed entry (sentry) capabilities.
endif::[]

#Begin changed since last ARC review#

The capabilities of this chapter define a 1-bit field for <<sec_cap_type>> values;
this field directly encodes the values `0` and `1`.
The value `1` is...

* considered <<sec_cap_type_ambient,ambiently available>> for <<CBLD>>,

* used as the type for capabilities sealed by <<SENTRY>> instructions,
  regardless of the input capability's permission,
  if <<section_rvy_sentry_insn_ext>> is present in the platform.

Additionally, <<JALR_CHERI>> both

* unseals input capabilities of type 1 and

* seals its return capabilities with type 1.

<<JALR_CHERI>> places no constraints on the triple of input <<sec_cap_type>> value, `{cd}` selector, and `{cs1}` selector.
That is, <<JALR_CHERI>> will, as directed, attempt to jump to any unsealed or sealed capability in any register regardless of which register comes to hold the sealed return pointer.

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
[NOTE]
=====
The permission encodings of <<rvy64_cap_description>> do not provide mappings for
the <<section_zyseal>> extension's <<zyseal_se_perm>> or <<zyseal_us_perm>>.
Thus, without further revision, the encodings of this chapter
are incompatible with the <<section_zyseal>> extension.

[#section_cap_bounds]
==== Bounds (EF, T, TE, B, BE) Encoding

===== Concept

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The sense of the exponent is reversed, so an encoded
value of 0 represents CAP_MAX_E, and CAP_MAX_E represents 0 from the previous
specification.
endif::[]

The bounds encode the base and top addresses that constrain memory accesses.
The capability can be used to access any memory location A in the range base
&#8804; A < top. The bounds are encoded in a compressed format, so it is not
possible to encode any arbitrary combination of base and top addresses. An
invalid capability with {ctag} cleared is produced when attempting to construct a
capability that is not _representable_ because its bounds cannot be correctly
encoded. The bounds are decoded as described in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short].

The bounds field has the following components:

* *T:* Value substituted into the capability's address to decode the top
address
* *B:* Value substituted into the capability's address to decode the base
address
* *E:* Exponent that determines the position at which B and T are substituted
into the capability's address
* *EF:* Exponent format flag indicating the encoding for T, B and E
    ** The exponent is stored in T and B if EF=0, so it is 'internal'
    ** The exponent is zero if EF=1

The bit width of T and B are defined in terms of the mantissa width (MW) which
is set depending on capability encoding as shown in
xref:rvy64_uni_base_name_param_summary[xrefstyle=short].

The exponent E indicates the position of T and B within the capability's
address as described in xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short]. The bit
width of the exponent (EW) is set depending on the encoding. The
maximum value of the exponent is calculated as follows:

[source]
----
CAP_MAX_E = XLEN - MW + 2
----

The values of EW and CAP_MAX_E are shown in
xref:rvy64_uni_base_name_param_summary[xrefstyle=short].

NOTE: The address and bounds must be representable in valid capabilities i.e.,
when the {ctag} is set (see xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]).

[#section_cap_bounds_decoding]
===== Decoding

The metadata is encoded in a compressed format termed CHERI Concentrate cite:[woodruff2019cheri]. It
uses a floating point representation to encode the bounds relative to the
capability address. The base and top addresses from the bounds are decoded as
shown below.

WARNING: The pseudocode below does not have a formal notation.
It is a place-holder until the sail implementation has been integrated in the specification.
In this notation, `/` means "integer division", `[]` are the bit-select operators, and arithmetic is signed.

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The IE bit from CHERI v9 is renamed EF and its value is
inverted to ensure that the <<null-cap>> capability is encoded as zero without the
need for CHERI v9's in-memory format. +
When EF=1, the exponent E=0, so the address bits a[MW - 1:0] are replaced
with T and B to form the top and base addresses respectively. +
When EF=0, the exponent `E=CAP_MAX_E - ( (XLEN == 32) ? { L~8~, TE, BE } : { TE, BE } )`,
so the address bits a[E + MW - 1:E] are replaced with T and B to form the top
and base addresses respectively. E is computed by subtracting from the maximum
possible exponent CAP_MAX_E which can be efficiently implemented in hardware
assuming that T and B are at bit CAP_MAX_E and performing a logical bitwise
shift right by E. In contrast, CHERI v9 implementations computed the top and
base addresses by assuming that T and B are at bit 0 and performing a logical
bitwise shift left by E.

The bounds are decoded as shown in xref:top_bound_dec[xrefstyle=short] and
xref:base_bound_dec[xrefstyle=short].

xref:top_bound_dec[xrefstyle=short] and xref:base_bound_dec[xrefstyle=short]
include ranges which may not be present when the bounds are decoded:

* If E = 0 the lower section does not exist.
* If E+MW=XLEN then the top section is only the least signification bit of
 c~t~ for the top bound, and top section doesn't exist for the bottom bound.
* If E+MW>XLEN then neither top section exists, and so the bounds are calculated
 with no depending on the address field _a_.

The corrections c~t~ and c~b~ are calculated as as shown below using the
definitions in xref:cap_encoding_ct[xrefstyle=short] and
xref:cap_encoding_cb[xrefstyle=short].

|==============================================================================

The base, _b_, and top, _t_, addresses are derived from the address by
substituting _a_[E + MW - 1:E] with B and T respectively and clearing the
lower E bits.  The most significant bits of _a_ may be adjusted up or down by 1
using corrections _c~b~_ and _c~t~_ to allow encoding memory regions that span
alignment boundaries.

The EF bit selects between two cases:

1. EF = 1: The exponent is 0. When `enableL8=1`, L~8~ encodes the MSB of the length,
which can be used to derive T[MW-1:MW-2], forming a full MW-wide T field.
2. EF = 0: The exponent is _internal_ with E stored in the lower bits of T and
B, with L~8~ used for the MSB of E when `enableL8=1`. E is chosen so that the most
significant non-zero bit of the length of the region aligns with T[MW - 2] such
that this bit is implied by E.

The most significant two bits of T can be derived from B using
the equality `T = B + L`, where L[MW - 2] is known from the values of EF and E
(as well as L~8~ when `enableL8=1`).
A carry out is implied if `T[MW - 3:0] < B[MW - 3:0]` since it is
guaranteed that the top is larger than the base.

The compressed bounds encoding allows the address to roam over a large
_representable_ region while maintaining the original bounds. This is enabled by
defining a lower boundary R from the out-of-bounds values that allows us to
disambiguate the location of the bounds with respect to an out-of-bounds address.
R is calculated
relative to the base by subtracting 2^MW-2^ from B.
If B, T or _a_[E + MW - 1:E] is less than R, it is inferred that they lie in the
2^E+MW^ aligned region above R labeled space~U~ in
xref:cap_bounds_map[xrefstyle=short] and the corrections _c~t~_ and _c~b~_ are
computed accordingly. The overall effect is that the address can roam
2^E+MW^/4 bytes below
the base address and at least 2^E+MW^/4 bytes above the top address
while still allowing the bounds to be correctly decoded.

[#t_bound_msb_inversion]
===== Top bound MSB correction

A capability has _infinite_ bounds if its bounds cover the entire address space
such that the base address _b_=0 and the top address _t_&#8805;2^XLEN^,
i.e., _t_ is an XLEN + 1 bit value. However, _b_ is an
XLEN-bit value and the size mismatch introduces additional complications
when decoding, so the following condition is required to correct _t_ for
capabilities whose <<section_cap_representable_check>> wraps the edge of the address
space:

[source]
----
if ( (E < (CAP_MAX_E - 1)) & (t[XLEN: XLEN - 1] - b[XLEN - 1] > 1) )
    t[XLEN] = !t[XLEN]
----
NOTE: The comparison is _unsigned_.

That is, invert the most significant bit of _t_ if the decoded length of the
capability is larger than E.

NOTE: A capability has infinite bounds if E=CAP_MAX_E and it is not
malformed (see xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]); this check is
equivalent to _b_=0 and _t_&#8805;2^XLEN^.

[#section_cap_malformed]
===== Malformed Capability Bounds

A capability is _malformed_ if its bounds cannot be correctly decoded.
The following check indicates whether a capability is malformed.
If `enableL8` is true, the `L~8~` bit is available in the capability encoding format for extra precision when `EF=1`.

[source]
----
malformedMSB =  (E == CAP_MAX_E     && B         != 0)
             || (E == CAP_MAX_E - 1 && B[MW - 1] != 0)
malformedLSB =  (E  < 0) || (E == 0 && enableL8)
malformed    =  !EF && (malformedMSB || malformedLSB)
----

Capabilities with malformed bounds:

. Return both base and top bounds as zero, which affects instructions like <<GCBASE>>.
. Cause certain manipulation instructions like <<CADDI>> to always set the {ctag} of the result to zero.

===== <<AUIPC_CHERI>> Shift

#Begin new since last ARC review#

For the capabilities of this chapter, the <<section_auipc_shift>> value is 12.
The bounds encodings just described, for both 32- and 64-bit addresses,
have sufficient <<section_rep_check_concept,representability>> that no
<<AUIPC_CHERI>> instruction used to reach an in-bounds offset
will clear the {ctag}.

#End new since last ARC review#

[#section_special_caps_encoding]
=== Encoding of Special Capabilities

[#section_null_cap_encoding]
==== NULL Capability Encoding

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* Encoding <<null-cap>> as zeros removes the need for
the difference between in-memory and architectural format.
endif::[]

The <<null-cap>> capability is represented with 0 in all fields. This implies
that it has no permissions and its exponent E is CAP_MAX_E ({cap_rv64_exp_max}), so its bounds cover the entire address space such that the
expanded base is 0 and top is 2^XLEN^.

[#section_infinite_cap_encoding]
==== Infinite Capability Encoding

This encoding is for an _Infinite_ capability value, which
grants all permissions while its bounds also cover the whole address space.
It includes <<x_perm>> and so includes the <<m_bit>> if {cheri_default_ext_name} is supported.
This infinite capability is both a <<root-rx-cap>> and a <<root-rw-cap>> capability.

// Added note here for CHERIoT which enforces W xor X.
NOTE: This capability format has a single encoding for the _Infinite_ capability. The CHERIoT encoding format has separate roots for code and for data, and will be included in a future version of this specification.

^1^ Only present if `enableL8` is set.

^2^If an infinite capability is used as a constant in either hardware or software, then the address field will typically be set to zero.
 If the address field is non-zero then it is still referred to as an infinite capability, and it still has the authority to authorize all memory accesses.

Permissions added by extensions (such as those of <<section_zylevels1>>) are presumed present in Infinite capabilities.

[#section_cap_representable_check, reftext="Representable Range"]
=== Representable Range Check

The concept of the _representability check_ was introduced in <<section_rep_check_concept>>.

The definition of the check is:

* A source capability with address _a_, metadata _m_ that decodes to give the bounds _b_ and _t_.
* A derived capability with arbitrary address _a'_ with the same metadata _m_ that decodes to give the bounds _b'_ and _t'_.

The address _a'_ is within the source capability's _representable range_ if `b == b' && t == t'`.

If the address _a'_ is outside the _representable range_, then the derived capability has the {ctag} set to zero.

==== Practical Information

An artifact of the bounds encoding is that if the new address
causes `t != t'`, then it is also the case that `b != b'`.

The inverse is also true, if `b != b'` then `t != t'`.

Therefore, for representable range checking, it is acceptable
to either check `t == t'` or `b == b'`.

The top and bottom capability bounds are formed of two or three sections:

* Upper bits from the address
** This is only if the other sections do not fill the available bits (E + MW < XLEN)
* Middle bits from T and B decoded from the metadata
* Lower bits are set to zero
** This is only if there is an internal exponent (EF=0)

.Composition of the decoded top address bound
[#comp_addr_bounds,options=header,align="center",cols="2,4,2,2"]
|==============================================================================
| Configuration   | Upper Section (if E + MW < XLEN) | Middle Section | Lower Section
| EF=0            | address[XLEN-1:E + MW] + ct | T[MW - 1:0] | {E{1'b0}}
| EF=1, i.e., E=0 | address[XLEN-1:MW] + ct   2+| T[MW - 1:0]
|==============================================================================

The _representable range_ defines the range of addresses which do not corrupt
the bounds encoding. The encoding was first introduced in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short], and is repeated in a different
form in xref:comp_addr_bounds[xrefstyle=short] to aid this description.

For the address to be valid for the current bounds encoding, the value
in the _Upper Section_ of xref:comp_addr_bounds[xrefstyle=short] _must
not change_ as this will change the meaning of the bounds.  This
is because `T`, `B` and `E` will be unchanged for the source and
destination capabilities.  Therefore, the Middle and Lower sections
of the bounds calculation are also unchanged for source and
destination capabilities.

When E > CAP_MAX_E - 2, the calculation of the top bound is entirely derived
from `T` and `E` which will be identical for both the source and destination
capabilities, thus guaranteeing that `t == t'`.  Likewise, with such values of E, the
base bound is entirely derived from `B` and `E` and therefore `b == b'`.

The calculation of the MSB of the top bound maybe inverted as specified
xref:t_bound_msb_inversion[xrefstyle=short].
Assuming `(E < (CAP_MAX_E - 1))`, the truth-table for this inversion is as follows:

Inspection of xref:t_bound_msb_inversion_truth_table[xrefstyle=short] shows
that `output_t[XLEN]` does not depend on `input_t[XLEN]` as:

* `output_t[XLEN] = {input_t[XLEN-1], b[XLEN-1]} == 2'b01`.

This leads to the conclusions:

* If `t[XLEN-1] == t'[XLEN-1]` and `b[XLEN-1] == b'[XLEN-1]`, then it is guaranteed `t[XLEN] == t'[XLEN]`.
* If `t[XLEN-1] != t'[XLEN-1]` or `b[XLEN-1] != b'[XLEN-1]`, then the representable check will fail regardless of checking `t[XLEN] == t'[XLEN]`.

Therefore, for the purpose of representable range checking, it is not
required to check that `t[XLEN]==t'[XLEN]`.

Given that `t[XLEN]` is not part of the representable range check:

* when `E == CAP_MAX_E - 2`, `t[XLEN-1:E] == T[MW-1:0]` and `b[XLEN-1:E] == B[MW-1:0]`.

Therefore, `T` and `B` are both derived from the capabilities metadata and are
therefore constant.  Which means that in this case too, the representable
range check always passes.

As a result:

* If E > CAP_MAX_E - 3, then the representability check always passes, _even
though the bounds are only infinite if E = CAP_MAX_E_

This gives a range of `s=2^E+MW^`, as shown in
xref:cap_bounds_map[xrefstyle=short].

The gap between the object bounds and the bound of the representable range
is always guaranteed
to be at least 1/4 of `s`. This is represented by `R = B - 2^MW-2^` in
xref:section_cap_encoding[xrefstyle=short].
This gives useful guarantees, such that if an executed instruction is in
<<pcc>> bounds, then it is also guaranteed that the next linear instruction
is _representable_.
