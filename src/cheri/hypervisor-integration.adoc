[#section_hypervisor_integration]
== "{cheri_priv_h_ext}", Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name} with the Hypervisor Extension

ifdef::cheri_standalone_spec[]
WARNING: This chapter will appear in the priv spec. Exact location TBD.

The RISC-V hypervisor (H) extension virtualizes the supervisor-level
architecture to support the efficient hosting of guest operating systems atop a
type-1 or type-2 hypervisor cite:[riscv-priv-spec].
endif::[]

The hypervisor extension is
generally orthogonal to CHERI; the main requirements, when integrating with
{cheri_base_ext_name} and {cheri_default_ext_name}, is that address CSRs added
for hypervisors are extended to CLEN size.
The remainder of this chapter describes these changes in detail.

[#hstatus,reftext="hstatus"]
=== Hypervisor Status Register (hstatus)

The <<hstatus>> register operates as described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] except
for the VSXL field that controls the value of XLEN for VS-mode (known as
VSXLEN).

The encoding of the VSXL field is the same as the MXL field of **misa**. Only 1
and 2 are supported values for VSXL. When the implementation supports
{cheri_base_ext_name} (but not {cheri_default_ext_name}), then <<hstatus>>'s
VSXL must be read-only as described in xref:mstatus[xrefstyle=short] for
<<mstatus>>.SXL. When the implementation supports both {cheri_base_ext_name}
and {cheri_default_ext_name}, then VSXL behaves as described in
xref:mstatus_cheri[xrefstyle=short] for mstatus.SXL.

The VSBE field determines controls the endianness of explicit memory accesses
from VS-mode and implicit memory accesses to VS-level memory management data
structures. VSBE=0 indicates little endian and VSBE=1 is big endian. VSBE must
be read-only and equal to MBE when the implementation only supports
{cheri_base_ext_name}. VSBE is optionally writeable when
{cheri_default_ext_name} is also supported.

[#henvcfg_cheri,reftext="henvcfg {cheri_base_arch_name}"]
=== Hypervisor Environment Configuration Register (henvcfg)

The <<henvcfg_cheri>> register operates as described in the RISC-V Privileged
Specification. A new enable bit is added to <<henvcfg_cheri>> when the implementation
supports {cheri_default_ext_name} as shown in xref:henvcfgreg[xrefstyle=short].

.Hypervisor environment configuration register (*henvcfg*)
[#henvcfgreg]
include::img/henvcfgreg.edn[]

The CHERI Register Enable (CRE) bit controls whether explicit access to CHERI
registers is permitted when V=1. When <<henvcfg>>.CRE=1 and <<menvcfg>>.CRE=1
and <<mseccfg>>.CRE=1, CHERI registers can be read and written by VS-mode and
VU-mode. When <<henvcfg>>.CRE=0, CHERI registers are disabled in VS-mode and
VU-mode as described in xref:section_cheri_disable[xrefstyle=short].

The reset value is 0.

[#hedeleg,reftext="hedeleg"]
=== Hypervisor Exception Delegation Register (hedeleg)

Bits {cheri_excep_list} of <<hedeleg>> now refers to a valid exception and so can be used to
delegate CHERI exceptions to supervisor mode.

[#vsstatus,reftext="vsstatus"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Status Register (vsstatus)

The <<vsstatus>> register operates as described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]
except for the UXL field that controls the value of XLEN for VU-mode.

The encoding of the UXL field is the same as the MXL field of **misa**. Only 1
and 2 are supported values for UXL. When the implementation supports
{cheri_base_ext_name} (but not {cheri_default_ext_name}), then <<vsstatus>>.UXL
must be read-only as described in xref:mstatus[xrefstyle=short] for
<<mstatus>>.UXL. When the implementation supports both {cheri_base_ext_name}
and {cheri_default_ext_name}, then UXL behaves as described in
xref:mstatus_cheri[xrefstyle=short] for mstatus.UXL.

[#vstvec,reftext="vstvec"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Vector Base Address Register (vstvec)

The <<vstvec>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is
the VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is the VS mode's version of the
supervisor register <<stvec>>.

.Virtual supervisor trap vector base address register
include::img/vstvecreg.edn[]

[#vstvecc,reftext="vstvecc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Vector Base Address Capability Register (vstvecc)

The <<vstvecc>> register extends <<vstvec>> to hold a capability.
Its reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

.Virtual supervisor trap vector base address capability register
include::img/vstveccreg.edn[]

The handling of <<vstvecc>> is otherwise identical to <<mtvecc>>, but in
virtual supervisor mode.

[#vsscratch,reftext="vsscratch"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Scratch Register (vsscratch)

The <<vsscratch>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is a
VSXLEN read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register
<<sscratch>>. <<vsscratch>> is extended into <<vsscratchc>>.

.Virtual supervisor scratch register
include::img/vsscratchreg.edn[]

[#vsscratchc,reftext="vsscratchc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Scratch Register (vsscratchc)

The <<vsscratchc>> register extends <<vsscratch>> to hold a capability.

{TAG_RESET_SCSR}

It is not WARL, all capability fields must be implemented.

.Virtual supervisor scratch capability register
include::img/vsscratchcreg.edn[]

[#vsepc,reftext="vsepc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Exception Program Counter (vsepc)

The <<vsepc>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It is extended
into <<vsepcc>>.

.Virtual supervisor exception program counter
include::img/vsepcreg.edn[]

[#vsepcc,reftext="vsepcc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Exception Program Counter Capability (vsepcc)

The <<vsepcc>> register extends <<vsepc>> to hold a capability.
Its reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

As shown in xref:CSR_exevectors[xrefstyle=short], <<vsepcc>> is a code capability, so it does not need to be able to hold all possible invalid addresses (see <<section_invalid_addr_conv>>).
Additionally, the capability in <<vsepcc>> is unsealed when it is written to <<pcc>> on execution of an <<SRET_CHERI>> instruction when V=1.
The handling of <<vsepcc>> is otherwise identical to <<mepcc>>, but in VS-mode.

include::img/vsepccreg.edn[]

[#vscause,reftext="vscause"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Cause Register (vscause)

The <<vscause>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. It must
additionally support the new exception code for CHERI exceptions that
<<scause>> supports.

[#vstval,reftext="vstval"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Trap Value Register (vstval)

The <<vstval>> register is a VSXLEN-bit read-write register.

<<vstval>> is updated following the same rules as <<mtval>> for CHERI exceptions
and <<cheri_pte_fault,CHERI PTE page faults>> which are delegated to VS-mode.

.Virtual supervisor trap value register
[#vstval-format]
include::img/vstvalreg.edn[]

[#vstidc,reftext="vstidc"]
=== Virtual Supervisor Thread Identifier Capability (vstidc)

The <<vstidc>> register is used to identify the current software thread in virtual supervisor mode.
It is used to identify the current software thread in
As other Virtual Supervisor registers when V=1, <<vstidc>> substitutes
for <<stidc>>, so that instructions that normally read or modify
<<stidc>> actually access <<vstidc>> instead.
When V=0, <<vstidc>> does not directly affect the
behavior of the machine.
On reset the valid tag of <<vstidc>> will be set to 0 and the remainder
of the data is UNSPECIFIED.

=== "Smstateen/Ssstateen" Integration
The new TID bit controls access to the <<vstidc>> CSR.

//=== Existing Hypervisor Load and Store Instructions
//
//The hypervisor extension defines several integer load and store instructions
//(such as <<HLV_W>>, <<HSV_W>> and <<HLVX_WU>>) that transfer the amount of data
//described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] between the registers and memory as though
//V=1. These instructions change behavior depending on the CHERI execution mode
//although the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.
//
//When in {cheri_cap_mode_name}, the hypervisor load and
//store instructions behave as described in
//xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short]. In
//{cheri_int_mode_name}, the instructions behave as
//described in cite:[riscv-priv-spec] and rely on an *x* register operand
//providing the effective address for the memory access; the capability
//authorizing the memory access is <<ddc>>.
//
//The exception cases remain as described in
//xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short] regardless of the CHERI
//execution mode.

=== Hypervisor Load and Store Instructions For Capability Data

Hypervisor virtual-machine load (<<HLV_C>>) and store (<<HSV_C>>)
instructions read or write CLEN bits from memory as though V=1. These
instructions change behavior depending on the CHERI execution mode although
the instruction's encoding remains unchanged.

When in {cheri_cap_mode_name}, the hypervisor
load and store capability instructions behave as described in
xref:section_existing_riscv_insns[xrefstyle=short]. In
{cheri_int_mode_name}, the instructions behave as rely
on an *x* register operand providing the effective address for the memory
access and the capability authorizing the memory access is <<ddc>>.
