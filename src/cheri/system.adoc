CHERI processors need memory systems which support the {ctag}s in memory.

There are, or will soon be, a wide range of CHERI systems in existence from tiny IoT devices up to server chips.

There are two types of bus connections used in SoCs which contain CHERI CPUs:

. Tag-aware busses, where the bus protocol is extended to carry the {ctag} along with the data.  This is typically done using user defined bits in the protocol.
.. These busses will read tags from memory (if tags are present in the target memory) and return them to the requestor.
.. These busses will write the {ctag} to memory as an extension of the data write.
. Non-tag aware busses, i.e., current non-CHERI aware busses.
.. Reads of tagged memory will not read the {ctag}.
.. Writes to tagged memory will set the {ctag} to zero of any CLEN-aligned CLEN-wide memory location where any byte matches the memory write.

The fundamental rule for any CHERI system is that the {ctag} and data are always accessed atomically. For every naturally aligned CLEN-wide memory location, it must never be possible to:

. Update any data bytes without also writing the {ctag}
.. This implies setting the {ctag} to zero if a non-CHERI aware bus master overwrites a capability in memory
. Read a {ctag} value with mismatched (stale or newer) data
. Set the {ctag} without also writing the data.

NOTE: Clearing tags in memory does not necessarily require updating the associated data.

=== Small CHERI system example

[#small_cheri_system]
.Example small CHERI system with local {ctag} storage

This example shows a minimum sized system where only the local memory is extended to support {ctag}s.
The {ctag}-aware region is highlighted.
All tags are created by the CHERI CPU, and only stored locally. The memory is shared with the system, probably via a secure DMA, which is not tag aware.

Therefore the connection between CPU and memory is tag-aware, and the connection to the system is not tag aware.

All writes from the system port to the memory must clear any memory tags to follow the rules from above.

=== Large CHERI system example

[#large_cheri_system]
.Example large CHERI system with tag cache

In the case of a large CHERI SoC with caches, all the cached memory visible to the CHERI CPUs must support tags.
All memory is backed up by DRAM, and standard DRAM does not offer the extra bit required for CHERI {ctag} storage and so a typical system will have a tag cache IP.

A region of DRAM is typically reserved for CHERI {ctag} storage.

The {ctag} cache sits on the boundary of the {ctag}-aware and non-tag-aware memory domains, and it provides the bridge between the two.
It stores tags locally in its cache, and if there is a miss, it will create an extra bus request to access the region of DRAM reserved for tag storage.
Therefore in the case of a miss a single access is split into two - one to access the data and one to access the {ctag}.

The key property of the {ctag} cache is to preserve the atomic access of data and tags in the memory system so that all CPUs have a consistent view of tags and data.

The region of DRAM reserved for tag storage must be only accessible by the {ctag} cache, therefore no bus initiators should be able to write to the DRAM without the transactions passing through the {ctag} cache.

Therefore the GPUs and peripherals cannot write to the {ctag} storage in the DRAM, or the {ctag}ged memory data storage region.
These constraints will be part of the design of the network-on-chip.
It _is_ possible for the GPU and peripherals to read the {ctag}ged memory data storage region of the DRAM, if required.

NOTE: It would be possible to allow a DMA to access the {ctag}ged memory region of the DRAM directly to allow swap to/from DRAM and external devices such as flash.
 This will require the highest level of security in the SoC, as the CHERI protection model relies on the integrity of the {ctag}s, and so the root-of-trust will need to authenticate and encrypt the transfer, with anti-rollback protection.

=== Large CHERI pure-capability system example

[#large_cheri_purecap_system]
.Example large CHERI system with only tag-aware bus masters
image::../cheri/img/large_cheri_purecap_system.drawio.png[width=80%,align=center]

In this example every DRAM access passes through the {ctag} cache, and so _all_ bus masters are {ctag}-aware and can access the {ctag}s associated with memory if permitted by the network-on-chip.

The system topology is simpler than in xref:large_cheri_system[xrefstyle=short].

There is likely to be a performance difference between the two systems.
The main motivation for xref:large_cheri_system[xrefstyle=short] is to avoid the GPU DRAM traffic needing to look-up every tag in the {ctag} cache, potentially adding overhead to every transaction.
