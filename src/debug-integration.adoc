=== Integrating {cheri_base_ext_name} with Sdext

This section describes changes to integrate the Sdext ISA and
{cheri_base_ext_name}. It must be implemented to make external debug compatible
with {cheri_base_ext_name}. Modifications to Sdext are kept to a minimum.

WARNING: This section is preliminary as no-one has yet built debug support
 for CHERI-RISC-V so change is likely.

The following features, which are optional in Sdext, must be implemented for
use with {cheri_base_ext_name}:

* The `hartinfo` register must be implemented.
* All harts which support {cheri_base_ext_name} must provide
  `hartinfo.nscratch` of at least 1 and implement the <<dscratch0c>> register.
* All harts which support {cheri_base_ext_name} must provide
  `hartinfo.datasize` of at least 1 and `hartinfo.dataaccess` of 0.
* The program buffer must be implemented, with `abstractcs.progbufsize` of at
  least 4 if `dmstatus.impebreak` is 1, or at least 5 if `dmstatus.impebreak`
  is 0.

[NOTE]
====
These requirements allow a debugger to read and write capabilities in integer
registers without disturbing other registers.  These requirements may be
relaxed if some other means of accessing capabilities in integer registers,
such as an extension of the Access Register abstract command, is added.  The
following sequences demonstrate how a debugger can read and write a capability
in `c1` if `MXLEN` is 64, `hartinfo.dataaccess` is 0, `hartinfo.dataaddr` is
0xBF0, `hartinfo.datasize` is 1, `dmstatus.impebreak` is 0, and
`abstractcs.progbufsize` is 5:

----
# Read the high MXLEN bits into data0-data1
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
gchi   x2, c1
csrw   0xBF0, x2
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
ebreak

# Read the tag into data0
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
gctag  x2, c1
csrw   0xBF0, x2
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
ebreak

# Write the high MXLEN bits from data0-data1
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
csrr   x2, 0xBF0
schi   c1, c1, x2
csrrw  c2, dscratch0c, c2
ebreak

# Write the tag (if nonzero)
csrrw   c2, dscratch0c, c2
csrr    c2, dinfc
cbld    c1, c2, c1
csrrw   c2, dscratch0c, c2
ebreak
----

The low `MXLEN` bits of a capability are read and written using normal Access
Register abstract commands.  If <<dscratch0c>> were known to be preserved
between abstract commands, it would be possible to remove the requirements on
`hartinfo.datasize`, `hartinfo.dataaccess`, and `abstractcs.progbufsize`,
however there is no way to discover the former property.

==== Debug Mode

When executing code due to an abstract command, the hart stays in debug mode
and the rules outlined in Section 4.1 of cite:[riscv-debug-spec]
apply.

==== Core Debug Registers

{cheri_base_ext_name} renames and extends debug CSRs that are designated to
hold addresses to be able to hold capabilities. The renamed debug CSRs are
listed in xref:dcsrnames-renamed[xrefstyle=short].

The <<pcc>> must grant <<asr_perm>> to access debug CSRs. This permission is
automatically provided when the hart enters debug mode as described
in the <<dpcc>> section. The <<pcc>> metadata can only be changed if the
implementation supports executing control transfer instructions from the
program buffer -- this is an optional feature according to
cite:[riscv-debug-spec].

[#dpc,reftext="dpc"]
==== Debug Program Counter (dpc)

The <<dpc>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is a
DXLEN-bit register used as the PC saved when entering debug mode. <<dpc>> is
extended into <<dpcc>>.

[#dpcc,reftext="dpcc"]
==== Debug Program Counter Capability (dpcc)

The <<dpcc>> register is a renamed extension to <<dpc>> that is able to hold a
capability.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Debug program counter capability
include::img/dpccreg.edn[]

Upon entry to debug mode, cite:[riscv-debug-spec], does not specify how to
update the PC, and says PC relative instructions may be illegal. This concept
is extended to include any instruction which reads or updates <<pcc>>, which refers to
all jumps, conditional branches and <<AUIPC>>. The exception is <<MODESW>>
which _is_ supported if {cheri_default_ext_name} is implemented, see <<dinfc>>
for details.

As a result, the value of <<pcc>> is UNSPECIFIED in debug mode according
to this specification. The <<pcc>> metadata has no architectural effect in debug
mode. Therefore <<asr_perm>> is implicitly granted for access to all CSRs and
no PCC faults are possible.

<<dpcc>> (and consequently <<dpc>>) are updated with the
capability in <<pcc>> whose address field is set to the address of the next
instruction to be executed as described in cite:[riscv-debug-spec] upon
debug mode entry.

When leaving debug mode, the capability in <<dpcc>> is unsealed and written
into <<pcc>>.  A debugger may write <<dpcc>> to change where the hart resumes
and its mode, permissions, sealing or bounds.

The legalisation of <<dpcc>> follows the same rules described for <<mepcc>>.

[#dscratch0,reftext="dscratch0"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 0 (dscratch0)

The <<dscratch0>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is an
optional DXLEN-bit scratch register that can be used by implementations which
need it. <<dscratch0>> is extended into <<dscratch0c>>.

.Debug scratch 0 register
include::img/dscratch0reg.edn[]

[#dscratch0c,reftext="dscratch0c"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 0 Capability (dscratch0c)

The <<dscratch0c>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit renamed extension to
<<dscratch0>> that is able to hold a capability.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

[#dscratch1,reftext="dscratch1"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 1 (dscratch1)

The <<dscratch1>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is an
optional DXLEN-bit scratch register that can be used by implementations which
need it. <<dscratch1>> is extended into <<dscratch1c>>.

.Debug scratch 1 register
include::img/dscratch1reg.edn[]

[#dscratch1c,reftext="dscratch1c"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 1 Capability (dscratch1c)

The <<dscratch1c>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit renamed extension to
<<dscratch1>> that is able to hold a capability.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Debug scratch 1 capability register
include::img/dscratch1creg.edn[]

[#dinfc,reftext="dinfc"]
==== Debug Infinite Capability Register (dinfc)

The <<dinfc>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit CSR only accessible in debug mode.

The reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability with the <<m_bit>> set to {CAP_MODE_VALUE},
regardless of whether {cheri_default_ext_name} (see xref:section-cheri-execution-mode[xrefstyle=short])
is implemented:

<<dinfc>> is read/write but with no writeable fields, and so writes are
ignored.

NOTE: A future version of this specification may add writeable fields to allow creation
 of other capabilities, if, for example, a future extension requires multiple formats for
 the <<infinite-cap>> capability.
