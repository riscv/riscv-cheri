=== Integrating Zcheri_purecap with Sdext

This section describes changes to integrate the Sdext ISA and
{cheri_base_ext_name}. It must be implemented to make external debug compatible
with {cheri_base_ext_name}. Modifications to Sdext are kept to a minimum.

WARNING: This section is preliminary as no-one has yet built debug support
 for CHERI-RISC-V so change is likely.

==== Debug Mode

When executing code due to an abstract command, the hart stays in debug mode
and the rules outlined in Section 4.1 of cite:[riscv-debug-spec]
apply.

==== Core Debug Registers

{cheri_base_ext_name} renames and extends debug CSRs that are designated to
hold addresses to be able to hold capabilities. The renamed debug CSRs are
listed in xref:dcsrnames-renamed[xrefstyle=short].

The <<pcc>> must grant <<asr_perm>> to access debug CSRs. This permission is
automatically provided when the hart enters debug mode as described
in the <<dpcc>> section. The <<pcc>> metadata can only be changed if the
implementation supports executing control transfer instructions from the
program buffer -- this is an optional feature according to
cite:[riscv-debug-spec].

[#dpc,reftext="dpc"]
==== Debug Program Counter (dpc)

The <<dpc>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is a
DXLEN-bit register used as the PC saved when entering debug mode. <<dpc>> is
extended into <<dpcc>>.

[#dpcc,reftext="dpcc"]
==== Debug Program Counter Capability (dpcc)

The <<dpcc>> register is a renamed extension to <<dpc>> that is able to hold a
capability.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

.Debug program counter capability
include::img/dpccreg.edn[]

Upon entry to debug mode, cite:[riscv-debug-spec], does not specify how to
update the PC, and says PC relative instructions may be illegal. This concept
is extended to include any instruction which reads or updates <<pcc>>, which refers to
all jumps, conditional branches and <<AUIPC>>. The exception is <<MODESW>>
which _is_ supported if {cheri_mode_ext_name} is implemented, see <<dinfc>>
for details.

As a result, the value of <<pcc>> is UNSPECIFIED in debug mode according
to this specification. The <<pcc>> metadata has no architectural effect in debug
mode. Therefore <<asr_perm>> is implicitly granted for access to all CSRs and
no PCC faults are possible.

<<dpcc>> (and consequently <<dpc>>) are updated with the
capability in <<pcc>> whose address field is set to the address of the next
instruction to be executed as described in cite:[riscv-debug-spec] upon
debug mode entry.

When leaving debug mode, the capability in <<dpcc>> is unsealed and written
into <<pcc>>.  A debugger may write <<dpcc>> to change where the hart resumes
and its mode, permissions, sealing or bounds.

[#dscratch0,reftext="dscratch0"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 0 (dscratch0)

The <<dscratch0>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is an
optional DXLEN-bit scratch register that can be used by implementations which
need it. <<dscratch0>> is extended into <<dscratch0c>>.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

[#dscratch0c,reftext="dscratch0c"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 0 (dscratch0c)

The <<dscratch0c>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit renamed extension to
<<dscratch0>> that is able to hold a capability. Its reset value is the
<<null-cap>> capability.

[#dscratch1,reftext="dscratch1"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 1 (dscratch1)

The <<dscratch1>> register is as defined in cite:[riscv-debug-spec]. It is an
optional DXLEN-bit scratch register that can be used by implementations which
need it. <<dscratch1>> is extended into <<dscratch1c>>.

{TAG_RESET_CSR}

include::img/dscratch1reg.edn[]

[#dscratch1c,reftext="dscratch1c"]
==== Debug Scratch Register 1 (dscratch1c)

The <<dscratch1c>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit renamed extension to
<<dscratch1>> that is able to hold a capability. Its reset value is the
<<null-cap>> capability.

include::img/dscratch1creg.edn[]

[#dinfc,reftext="dinfc"]
==== Debug Infinite Capability Register (dinfc)

The <<dinfc>> register is a CLEN-bit plus tag bit CSR only accessible in debug mode.

The reset value is the <<infinite-cap>> capability.

If {cheri_mode_ext_name} (see xref:chapter-Zcheri-mode) is implemented:

. the core enters Capability Mode when entering debug mode
.. therefore <<dinfc>>.M is set whenever entering debug mode for any reason.
. the mode can be optionally switched using <<MODESW>>, and the result observed in <<dinfc>>.M.

<<dinfc>> is read/write but with no writeable fields, and so writes are
ignored.

NOTE: A future version of this specification may add writeable fields to allow creation
 of other capabilities, if, for example, a future extension requires multiple formats for
 the <<infinite-cap>> capability.
