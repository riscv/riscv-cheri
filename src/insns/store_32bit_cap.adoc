{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Store the CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory. The capability in `cs1`
authorizes the operation. The effective address of the memory access is
obtained by adding the address of `cs1` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. The
capability written to memory has the tag set to 0 if the tag of `cs2` is 0 or
`cs1` does not grant <<c_perm>>.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
Store the CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory. The capability
authorising the operation is <<ddc>>. The effective address of the memory
access is obtained by adding `rs1` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset. The
capability written to memory has the tag set to 0 if `cs2` 's tag is 0 or
<<ddc>> does not grant <<c_perm>>.
