NOTE: The RV64 encoding is intended to also allocate the encoding for SQ for RV128.

Synopsis::
Store capability

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`sc cs2, offset(cs1)`

{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`sc cs2, offset(rs1)`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/storecap.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Store the CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory. The capability in `cs1`
authorizes the operation. The effective address of the memory access is
obtained by adding the address of `cs1` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
Store the CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory. The capability
authorising the operation is <<ddc>>. The effective address of the memory
access is obtained by adding `rs1` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset.
