Synopsis::
Capability test subset

Mnemonic::
`scss rd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scss.adoc[]

Description::
`rd` is set to 1 if the tag of capabilities `cs1` and `cs2` are equal and the
bounds and permissions of `cs2` are a subset of those of `cs1`.

If either `cs1` or `cs2`:

. Have bounds which are <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>>, or
. Have any bits set in reserved fields, or
. Have permissions that could not have been legally produced by <<ACPERM>>

then the instruction returns zero.

NOTE: The implementation of this instruction is similar to <<CBLD>>, although
<<SCSS>> does not include the sealed bit in the check.
