Synopsis::
Capability stores (C.SC, C.SCSP), 16-bit encodings

include::xlen_variable_warning.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonics::
`c.sc cs2', offset(cs1')` +
`c.sc cs2', offset(csp)`

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Expansions::
`sc cs2', offset(cs1')` +
`sc cs2', offset(csp)`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/c-sp-store-cap.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Store the CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2'` to memory. The capability in `cs1/csp`
authorizes the operation. The effective address of the memory access is
obtained by adding the address of `cs1/csp` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset.

NOTE: These mnemonics do not exist in {cheri_int_mode_name}.

Tag of the written capability value::

The capability written to memory has the tag set to 0 if the tag of `cs2'` is 0 or if the authorizing capability (`cs1/csp`) does not grant <<c_perm>>.
+
The stored tag is also set to zero if the authorizing capability does not have <<sl_perm>> set but the stored data has a <<section_cap_level>> of 0 (_local_).
