Synopsis::
CSR access (CSRRW) 32-bit encodings

Mnemonics for accessing capability CSRs at CLEN-wide aliases::
`csrrw cd, cs1, csr`

Mnemonics for accessing XLEN-wide CSRs or capability CSRs at XLEN-wide aliases::
`csrrw rd, rs1, csr`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/csrw-instr.adoc[]

Description::
This is a standard RISC-V CSR instructions with extended functionality for
accessing CLEN-wide CSRs, such as <<mtvec>>/<<mtvecc>>, which can be
accessed through either the RISC-V address or the capability address alias.
+
See xref:aliased_CSRs[xrefstyle=short] for a list of CLEN-wide CSRs and
xref:extended_CSR_writing[xrefstyle=short] for the action taken on writing each one.
+
CSRRW writes `cs1` to the CLEN-wide alias of extended CSRs, and reads a full capability into `cd`.
+
CSRRW writes `rs1` to the XLEN-wide alias of extended CSRs, and reads the address field into `rd`.
+
Access to XLEN-wide CSRs from other extensions is as specified by RISC-V.


Permissions::
All non-user mode accessible CSRs require <<asr_perm>>, including existing RISC-V CSRs.

Prerequisites for capability address aliases::
{cheri_base_ext_name}

Prerequisites for legacy address aliases::
{cheri_legacy_ext_name}

Operation::
