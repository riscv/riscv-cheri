{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
A PREFETCH.R instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `cs1` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by a data read (i.e. load) in the near future. The
encoding is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorising capability for this
operation is `cs1`. This instruction does not throw any exceptions. However,
in following <<CHERI_SPEC>>, this instruction does not perform a prefetch
if it is not authorized by `cs1`.  This instruction does not perform a memory
access if one or more of the following conditions of `cs1` are met:
* The tag is not set
* The sealed bit is set
* No bytes of the cache line requested is in bounds
* The <<r_perm>> is not set

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
A PREFETCH.R instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `rs1` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by a data read (i.e. load) in the near future. The
encoding is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorising capability for this
operation is <<ddc>>.
