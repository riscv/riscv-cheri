Synopsis::
Hypervisor virtual-machine load capability

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`hlv.c cd, cs1`

{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`hlv.c cd, rs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/hypv-virt-load-cap.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Load a CLEN+1 bit value from memory as though V=1; i.e., with the address
translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory accesses in
either VS-mode or VU-mode. The effective address is the address of `cs1`. The
authorising capability for the operation is `cs1`. A copy of the loaded value
is written to `cd`.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
Load a CLEN+1 bit value from memory as though V=1; i.e., with the address
translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory accesses in
either VS-mode and VU-mode. The effective address is `rs1`. The authorising
capability for the operation is <<ddc>>. A copy of the loaded value is written
to `cd`.
