Synopsis::
Trap Return (MRET, SRET)

Mnemonics::
`mret` +
`sret`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/trap-return.adoc[]

Description::
Return from machine mode (<<MRET>>) or supervisor mode (<<SRET>>) trap handler
as defined by cite:[riscv-priv-spec]. MRET unseals <<mepcc>> and writes the
result into <<pcc>>. SRET unseals <<sepcc>> and writes the result into <<pcc>>.

Exceptions::
CHERI fault exceptions occur when <<pcc>> does not grant <<asr_perm>> because
<<MRET>> and <<SRET>> require access to privileged CSRs. When that exception
occurs, _CHERI instruction fetch fault_ is reported in the TYPE field and the
Permission violation code is reported in the CAUSE field of <<mtval>> or
<<stval>>.
