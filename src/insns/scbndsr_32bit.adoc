Synopsis::
Capability set bounds, rounding up if necessary

Mnemonic::
`scbndsr cd, cs1, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scbndsr_32bit.adoc[]

Description::
Capability register `cd`  is set to capability register `cs1`  with the base
address of its bounds replaced with the value of `cs1.address` field and
the length of its bounds set to `rs2`. The base is rounded down
and the length is rounded up by the smallest amount needed to form a representable
capability covering the requested bounds. In all cases, `cd.tag` is set to 0
if its bounds exceed `cs1` 's bounds, `cs1` 's tag is 0 or `cs1`  is sealed.

Exceptions::
