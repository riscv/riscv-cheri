ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* The implementation of this instruction changes
because the permission fields are encoded differently in the new
capability format.

NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* this instruction was called CANDPERM.

Synopsis::
Mask capability permissions

Mnemonics::
`acperm cd, cs1, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/acperm.adoc[]

Description::
ACPERM performs the following operations:

. Convert the AP and SDP fields of capability `cs1` into a bit field with the
format shown in xref:acperm_bit_field[xrefstyle=short].
. Calculate the bitwise AND of the bit field with the mask `rs2`.
. If the AP and <<m_bit>> field in `cs1` could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>> then
clear all AP permissions, and the <<m_bit>> to {CAP_MODE_VALUE}. Skip the next step.
. Clear AP permissions as required to meet the rules below.
. Encode the AP permissions for RV32 according to <<cap_perms_encoding32>>.
. Copy `cs1` to `cd`, and update the AP and SDP fields with the newly calculated versions.
. Set `cd.tag=0` if `cs1` is sealed or if any reserved fields of `cs1` are set.
+
Some combinations of permissions cannot be encoded for MXLEN=32, and are not useful when MXLEN=64.
These cases are defined to return useful minimal sets of permissions, which may be no permissions.
+
NOTE: Future extensions may allow more combinations of permissions, especially for MXLEN=64.
The rules from <<acperm_rules>> must be followed when removing permissions.

[#acperm_rules]
.ACPERM common rules
[float="center",align="center",cols="2,2,4",options="header"]
|===
| Rule            | Permission   | Only valid if
|  1  (RV32 only) | <<asr_perm>> | All other permissions are set.
|  2              | <<c_perm>>   | <<r_perm>> or <<w_perm>>
|  3  (RV32 only) | <<c_perm>>   | <<r_perm>>
|  4  (RV32 only) | <<x_perm>>   | <<r_perm>>
|  5  (RV32 only) | <<w_perm>>   | not(<<c_perm>>) or <<lm_perm>>
|  6  (RV32 only) | <<x_perm>>   | <<w_perm>> or <<c_perm>>
|  7              | <<el_perm>>  | <<c_perm>> and <<r_perm>>
|  8  (RV32 only) | <<el_perm>>  | <<lm_perm>>
|  9              | <<lm_perm>>  | <<c_perm>> and <<r_perm>>
| 10  (RV32 only) | <<lm_perm>>  | (<<w_perm>> or <<el_perm>>)
| 11              | <<sl_perm>>  | <<c_perm>>
| 12  (RV32 only) | <<sl_perm>>  | (<<lm_perm>> and (<<x_perm>> or <<w_perm>>))
| 13  (RV32 only) | <<x_perm>>   | (<<c_perm>> and <<lm_perm>> and <<el_perm>> and (<<sl_perm>> == âˆž)) or +
                                   (not(<<c_perm>> and not(<<lm_perm>>) and not(<<el_perm>>) and (<<sl_perm>>==0)))^1^
| 14              | <<asr_perm>> | <<x_perm>>
| 15^2^           | <<m_bit>>    | <<x_perm>> and {cheri_default_ext_name} is implemented
|===

^1^ All the listed permissions in the set are either minimum or maximum. +
^2^ For RV32, the encodings which have the <<m_bit>> set to {int_mode_value} for {cheri_int_mode_name}
 are only valid if {cheri_default_ext_name} is implemented. Otherwise those encodings represent invalid permissions.

CAUTION: For RV64 without {cheri_default_ext_name}, the <<m_bit>> is a _reserved_ bit, and so is not relevant to ACPERM.

The behavior of currently illegal combinations from <<acperm_rules>> is to clear the permission if invalid (or in the case of <<sl_perm>> set it to 0 (_local_)).

* For RV64 all such combinations may be redefined by future extensions.
* The RV32 only rules are added because they remove combinations which do not meet the encoding requirements for <<cap_perms_encoding32>>, or
<<cap_perms_encoding_levels32>> if <<cheri_levels_ext,{cheri_levels_ext_name}>> is implemented.

.Capability permissions bit field
[#acperm_bit_field]
include::../img/acperm_bit_field.edn[]

NOTE: The <<el_perm,EL>>, <<sl_perm,SL>> and <<section_cap_level,CL>> fields are only modifiable if the implementation supports <<cheri_levels_ext,{cheri_levels_ext_name}>>.


NOTE: Even though included here <<section_cap_level,CL>> is not considered an architectural permission.


NOTE: If a future extension adds a new permission that is a refinement of an existing permission (e.g. finer-grained <<asr_perm>>), then clearing the superset must also clear the refined permission.
This ensures software forward-compatibility: for example, a kernel that does not know about finer-grained <<asr_perm>> subsets must still be able to prevent all access to privileged instructions and CSRs by clearing <<asr_perm>>.
