instruction fetch in the near future

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
A PREFETCH.I instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `cs1` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by an instruction fetch in the near future. The encoding
is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorising capability for this operation is
`cs1`. This instruction does not throw any exceptions. However, following
xref:CHERI_SPEC[xrefstyle=short], this instruction does not perform a prefetch
if it is not authorized by `cs1`.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
A PREFETCH.I instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
effective address is the sum of the base address specified in `rs1` and the
sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000, is
likely to be accessed by an instruction fetch in the near future. The encoding
is only valid if imm[4:0]=0. The authorising capability for this operation is
<<pcc>>.
