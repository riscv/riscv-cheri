==== BEQ, BNE, BLT[U], BGE[U]

Synopsis::
Conditional branches (BEQ, BNE, BLT[U], BGE[U])

Mnemonics::
`beq rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bne rs1, rs2, imm` +
`blt rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bge rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bltu rs1, rs2, imm` +
`bgeu rs1, rs2, imm`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-conditional.adoc[]

Description::
Compare two integer registers `rs1` and `rs2` according to the indicated opcode
as described in cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec]. The 12-bit immediate encodes signed
offsets in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset is sign-extended and added to the
address of the branch instruction to give the target address. Then the target
address is written into the address field of <<pcc>>.
