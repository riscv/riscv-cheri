ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* this instruction was called CSEALENTRY.
endif::[]

Synopsis::
Seal capability as sealed entry.

Mnemonic::
`sentry cd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/sentry.adoc[]

Description::
Capability `cd` is written with the capability in `cs1` with its type bit set to 1.
Attempting to seal an already sealed capability will lead to the tag of `cd` being set to 0.

NOTE: The <<SENTRY>> instruction may give rise to an illegal instruction fault
when the implementation does not support capability type 1 (unrestricted
sentry; see xref:section_cap_sealed[xrefstyle=short]). This is not the case
when the implementation supports the capability encoding described in
xref:section_cap_description[xrefstyle=short].

Exceptions::
include::require_cre.adoc[]

Prerequisites::
