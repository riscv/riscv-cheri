==== CTESTSUBSET

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* ctestsubset does not use ddc if cs1==0
endif::[]

include::new_encoding_note.adoc[]

Synopsis::
Capability test subset

Mnemonic::
`ctestsubset rd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ctestsubset.adoc[]

Description::
`rd` is set to 1 if the tag of capabilities `cs1`  and `cs2`  are equal and the
bounds and permissions of `cs2`  are a subset of those of `cs1`. The case
`cs1 == 0` is trivally no subset and was chosen to be that for clean architecture
design.

NOTE: The implementation of this instruction is similar to <<CBUILDCAP>>, although
<<CTESTSUBSET>> does not include the sealed bit in the check.
