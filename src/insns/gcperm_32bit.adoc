Synopsis::
Capability get permissions

Mnemonic::
`gcperm rd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gcperm.adoc[]

Description::
If MXLEN=32 unpack permissions from the format in <<cap_perms_encoding32>>.
+
Convert the unpacked AP permissions as well as the SDP fields of capability `cs1`
into a bit field, with the format shown in xref:gcperm_bit_field[xrefstyle=short],
and write the result to `rd`. A bit set to 1 in the bit field indicates that
`cs1` grants the corresponding permission.
+
If the AP field cannot be produced by <<ACPERM>> then all architectural
permission bits in `rd` are set to 0.
