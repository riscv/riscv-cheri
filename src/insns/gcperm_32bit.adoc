Synopsis::
Capability get permissions

`gcperm rd, cs1`

Encoding::

Description::
Converts the AP and SDP fields of capability `cs1` into a bit field; one bit
per permission, as shown below, and write the result to `rd`. A bit set to 1
in the bit field indicates that `cs1` grants the corresponding permission.
+
If the AP field cannot be produced by <<ACPERM>> then all architectural
permission bits in `rd` are set to 0.
