Description::
Vector store, supporting CHERI capabilities.
+
The base address (`cs1`/`rs1`) is required to be `CLEN`-aligned, if it is not, a store/AMO address misaligned exception occurs.
+
Other than the support for CHERI capabilities, these instructions operate in the same way as the corresponding
vector unit-stride load instruction. For each *complete* `CLEN`-bit subdivision of the source
that is stored, the associated tag bit is written to memory along with the data.
If (`vl` * `EEW`) is not a multiple of `CLEN` then the tag that is written to memory
along with the data from the last `CLEN`-bit subdivision of the source (which only partially be written)
has the value zero
(the tag bit associated with that `CLEN`-bit subdivision of the source vector
register group is ignored, but remains unmodified).
+
Traps on these instructions will always be reported with a value of `vstart` that is a multiple of `CLEN` / `EEW`,
and will raise an illegal instruction exception if `vstart` does not meet this condition.
+
Implementations only provide the instructions dealing with the element widths they support. Instruction
encodings for unsupported element widths are reserved.
