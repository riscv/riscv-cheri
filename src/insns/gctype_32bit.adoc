Synopsis::
Capability get type

Mnemonic::
`gctype rd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gctype.adoc[]

Description::
Decode the architectural capability type from `cs1` and write the result to `rd`.
It is not required that the input capability `cs1`  has its tag set to 1.

NOTE: While the architectural capability type maps directly to the value of the `CT` capability bit in {cheri_base_ext_name}, future extensions may define an alternate mapping.
Therefore, software should always use <<GCTYPE>> to obtain the capability type rather than directly reading the high bits of the capability using <<GCHI>>.
