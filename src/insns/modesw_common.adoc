Description::
Toggle the hart's current CHERI execution mode in <<pcc>>.
+
* If the current mode in <<pcc>> is {cheri_int_mode_name} ({INT_MODE_VALUE}), then the <<m_bit>> in <<pcc>> is set to {cheri_cap_mode_name} ({CAP_MODE_VALUE}).
* If the current mode is {cheri_cap_mode_name} ({CAP_MODE_VALUE}), then the <<m_bit>> in <<pcc>> is set to {cheri_int_mode_name} ({INT_MODE_VALUE}).

NOTE: The effective CHERI execution mode is give by the value of some CSRs and
the <<pcc>>'s <<m_bit>>, so executing <<MODESW>> does not necessarily change
the machine's current mode. The current, effective CHERI execution mode can be
observed as described in xref:m_bit_observe[xrefstyle=short].

NOTE: Implementations may optionally support executing <<MODESW>> from the
program buffer while in debug mode. If supported them the <<m_bit>> in
<<dinfc>> is toggled and used to control which mode to enter next time debug
mode is entered. The CHERI execution mode is only controlled by the <<m_bit>>
of <<dinfc>> in debug mode.
