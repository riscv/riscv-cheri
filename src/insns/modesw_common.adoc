Description::
Toggle the hart's current CHERI execution mode in <<pcc>>.
+
* If the current mode in <<pcc>> is {cheri_int_mode_name}, then the mode bit (M) in <<pcc>> is set to {cheri_cap_mode_name}.
* If the current mode is {cheri_cap_mode_name}, then the mode bit (M) in <<pcc>> is set to {cheri_int_mode_name}.
+
In debug mode MODESW can still be used to change the operating mode, and the current
mode is shown in the M bit of <<dinfc>>.
