Description::
Toggle the hart's current CHERI execution mode in <<CEM>>. If the current mode in
<<CEM>> is Legacy, then <<CEM>> is set to Capability. If the
current mode is Capability, then <<CEM>> is set to Legacy.
+
If the execution mode is forced to Legacy due to CME=0 or disabled access to
CHERI registers at the current privilege level, MODESW causes an illegal
instruction exception.  Support for MODESW in debug mode is optional.
