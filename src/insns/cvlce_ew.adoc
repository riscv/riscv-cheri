Synopsis::
Vector load capability

Description::
Vector load, supporting CHERI capabilities.
+
The base address (`cs1`/`rs1`) is required to be `CLEN`-aligned, if it is a not, a load address misaligned exception occurs.
+
Other than the support for CHERI capabilities, these instructions operate in the same way as the corresponding
vector unit-stride load instruction. For each *complete* `CLEN`-bit subdivision of the destination that is
loaded, the associated tag bit is updated with the tag bit that is read from memory.
If (`vl` * `EEW`) is not a multiple of `CLEN` then the last `CLEN`-bit subdivision of
the destination that is updated with data from memory (which will be incomplete) has its associated tag bit
cleared.
+
Traps on these instructions will always be reported with a value of `vstart` that is a multiple of `CLEN` / `EEW`,
and will raise an illegal instruction exception if `vstart` does not meet this condition.
+
Implementations only provide the instructions dealing with the element widths they support. Instruction
encodings for unsupported element widths are reserved.
