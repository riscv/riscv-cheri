Exceptions::
CHERI fault exceptions when the authorising capability fails one of the checks
listed below; in this case, _CHERI data fault_ is reported in the <<mtval>> or
<<stval>> TYPE field and the corresponding code is written to CAUSE.

ifdef::cbo_inval[]
The CBIE bit in <<menvcfg>> and <<senvcfg>> indicates whether
CBO.INVAL performs cache block flushes instead of
invalidations for less privileged modes. The instruction checks shown in the
table below remain unchanged regardless of the value of CBIE and the privilege
mode.
