Synopsis::
Hypervisor virtual-machine store capability

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`hsv.c cs2, cs1`

{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`hsv.c cs2, rs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/hypv-virt-store-cap.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Store a CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory as though V=1; i.e., with the
address translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory
accesses in either VS-mode or VU-mode. The effective address is the address of
`cs1`. The authorising capability for the operation is `cs1`. The capability
written to memory has the tag set to 0 if the tag of `cs2` is 0 or `cs1` does
not grant <<c_perm>>.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
Store a CLEN+1 bit value in `cs2` to memory as though V=1; i.e., with the
address translation and protection, and endianness, that apply to memory
accesses in either VS-mode or VU-mode. The effective address is the `rs1`. The
authorising capability for the operation is <<ddc>>. The capability written to
memory has the tag set to 0 if the tag of `cs2` is 0 or <<ddc>> does not grant
<<c_perm>>.
