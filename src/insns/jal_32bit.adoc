==== JAL

Synopsis::
Jump and link

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jal cd, offset`

{cheri_int_mode_name} Mnemonic::
`jal rd, offset`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/ct-unconditional.adoc[]

{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
JAL's immediate encodes a signed offset in multiple of 2 bytes. The <<pcc>> is
incremented by the sign-extended offset to form the jump target capability. The
target capability is written to <<pcc>>. The <<pcc>> of the next instruction
following the jump is sealed and written to `cd`.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
JAL's immediate encodes a signed offset in multiple of 2 bytes. The
sign-extended offset is added to the <<pcc>>'s address to form the target
address which is written to the <<pcc>>'s address field. The address of the
instruction following the jump is written to `rd`.

Exceptions::
[%autowidth,options=header,align=center]

| CAUSE                      | {cheri_int_mode_name} | {cheri_cap_mode_name} | Reason
| Invalid address violation  | ✔    | ✔     | The target address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
| Bounds violation           | ✔    | ✔     | Minimum length instruction is not within the target capability's bounds.
