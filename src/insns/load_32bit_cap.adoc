{cheri_cap_mode_name} Description::
Load a CLEN+1 bit value from memory and writes it to `cd`. The capability in `cs1` authorizes the operation. The effective address of the memory access is obtained by adding the address of `cs1` to the sign-extended 12-bit offset.

{cheri_int_mode_name} Description::
Loads a CLEN+1 bit value from memory and writes it to `cd`. The capability
authorising the operation is <<ddc>>. The effective address of the memory
