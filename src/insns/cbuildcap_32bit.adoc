==== CBUILDCAP

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* cbuildcap does not use ddc if cs1==0
endif::[]

include::new_encoding_note.adoc[]

Synopsis::
Capability build

Mnemonic::
`cbuildcap cd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cbuildcap.adoc[]

Description::
Copy `cs2` to `cd` and set the tag to 1 if `cs1.tag` is set, `cs1` is not
sealed, `cs1` 's permissions and bounds are equal or a superset of `cs2` 's,
`cs2` 's bounds are not malformed (see
xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]), and all reserved bits in `cs2` 's
metadata are 0. <<CBUILDCAP>> is typically used alongside <<CSETHIGH>> to build
capabilities from integer values.

NOTE: Although currently this will set the tag to 0 and leave the metadata
otherwise unchanged when `cs1` is `c0`, this may change in future extensions,
and so software should not assume this.
