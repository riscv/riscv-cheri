==== CBUILDCAP

ifdef::cheri_v9_annotations[]
NOTE: *CHERI v9 Note:* cbuildcap does not use ddc if cs1==0
endif::[]

include::new_encoding_note.adoc[]

Synopsis::
Capability build

Mnemonic::
`cbuildcap cd, cs1, cs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/cbuildcap.adoc[]

Description::
Copy `cs2` to `cd` and set the tag to 1 if `cs1.tag` is set, `cs1` is not
sealed, `cs1` 's permissions and bounds are equal or a superset of `cs2` 's,
`cs2` 's bounds are not malformed (see
xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]), and all reserved bits in `cs2` 's
metadata are 0. <<CBUILDCAP>> is typically used alongside <<CSETHIGH>> to build
capabilities from integer values.

NOTE: The case `cs1 == 0` trivially leads to the tag of `cd` being stripped.
We opted to not make this a pseudo instruction to clear the tag of capability.
`cbuildcap cd, c0, cs2` will behave differently in the case of otypes being
added. Thus we reserve the encoding `cs1 == 0` for now.
