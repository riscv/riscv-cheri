Synopsis::
Stores (SD, SW, SH, SB)

Capability Mode Mnemonics (RV64)::
`sd rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sw rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sh rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sb rs2, offset(cs1)`

Legacy Mode Mnemonics (RV64)::
`sd rs2, offset(rs1)` +
`sw rs2, offset(rs1)` +
`sh rs2, offset(rs1)` +
`sb rs2, offset(rs1)`

Capability Mode Mnemonics (RV32)::
`sw rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sh rs2, offset(cs1)` +
`sb rs2, offset(cs1)`

Legacy Mode Mnemonics (RV32)::
`sw rs2, offset(rs1)` +

Capability Mode Description::
Store integer data of the indicated size (byte, halfword, word, double-word) to
memory. The effective address of the store is obtained by adding the
sign-extended 12-bit offset to the address of `cs1`. The authorising capability
for the operation is `cs1`. A copy of `rs2` is written to memory at the
location indicated by the effective address and the tag bit of each block of
memory naturally aligned to CLEN/8 is cleared.

Legacy Mode Description::
Store integer data of the indicated size (byte, halfword, word, double-word) to
memory. The effective address of the store is obtained by adding the
sign-extended 12-bit offset to `rs1`. The authorising capability for the
operation is <<ddc>>. A copy of `rs2` is written to memory at the location
indicated by the effective address and the tag bit of each block of memory
naturally aligned to CLEN/8 is cleared.
