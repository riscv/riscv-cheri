Synopsis::
Capability get length

Mnemonic::
`gclen rd, cs1`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/gclen.adoc[]

Description::
Calculate the length of `cs1` 's bounds and write the result in `rd`. The length
is defined as the difference between the decoded bounds' top and base addresses
i.e. `top - base`. It is not required that the input capability `cs1`  has its
tag set to 1. <<GCLEN>> outputs 0 if `cs1` 's bounds are malformed (see
xref:section_cap_malformed[xrefstyle=short]), and 2^MXLEN^-1 if the length of
`cs1` is 2^MXLEN^.
