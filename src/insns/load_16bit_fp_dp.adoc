Synopsis::
Double precision floating point loads (C.FLD, C.FLDSP), 16-bit encodings

Capability Mode Mnemonics (RV32)::
`c.fld frd', offset(cs1'/csp)`

Capability Mode Expansions (RV32)::
`fld frd', offset(csp)`

Legacy Mode Mnemonics::
`c.fld fs2, offset(rs1'/sp)`

Legacy Mode Expansions::
`fld fs2, offset(rs1'/sp)`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/c-sp-load-css-dp.adoc[]
include::wavedrom/c-sp-load-css-dp-sprel.adoc[]

Legacy Mode Description::
Standard floating point stack pointer relative load instructions, authorised by the capability in <<ddc>>. Note that these instructions are not available in Capability Mode, as they have been remapped to <<C.LC>>, <<C.LCSP>>.
