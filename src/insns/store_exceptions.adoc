Exceptions::
ifdef::store_cond[]
All misaligned store conditionals cause a store/AMO address misaligned exception to allow software emulation (if the Zam extension is supported, see cite:[riscv-unpriv-spec]), otherwise they take a store/AMO access fault exception.

endif::[]
ifdef::has_cap_data[]
Misaligned address fault exception when the effective address is not aligned
to CLEN/8.

endif::[]
CHERI fault exceptions occur when the authorizing capability fails one of the checks
listed below; in this case, _CHERI data fault_ is reported in the <<mtval2>>,
<<stval2>> or <<vstval2>> TYPE field and the corresponding code is written to CAUSE.

|==============================================================================
| CAUSE                 | Reason
| Tag violation         | Authority capability tag set to 0, or has any reserved bits set
| Seal violation        | Authority capability is sealed
| Permission violation  | Authority capability does not grant <<w_perm>>, or the AP field could not have been produced by <<ACPERM>>
| Invalid address violation  | The effective address is invalid according to xref:section_invalid_addr_conv[xrefstyle=short]
| Bounds violation      | At least one byte accessed is outside the authority capability bounds, or the capability has <<section_cap_malformed,malformed>> bounds

If virtual memory is enabled on an RV64 hart, then the state of <<cheri_pte_ext,PTE>>.CW,
and, if {cheri_pte_ext_name} is implemented, <<cheri_pte_ext,PTE>>.CRG from the current virtual memory page may
cause a <<cheri_pte_ext,CHERI PTE store/AMO page fault>> exception in addition to a normal RISC-V page fault
when operating in user mode.
See <<mtval2-page-fault>> for the exception reporting in this case.
