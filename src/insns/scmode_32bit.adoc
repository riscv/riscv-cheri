Synopsis::
Capability set CHERI execution mode

Mnemonic::
`scmode cd, cs1, rs2`

Encoding::
include::wavedrom/scmode.adoc[]

Description::
Copy `cs1`  to `cd`  and set `cd.M` (the mode bit) to the least significant bit of
`rs2` . `cd.tag` is set to 0 if `cs1`  is sealed.

[NOTE]
======
Setting the mode bit on non-executable capabilities is not supported and may be ignored.
The reason for this is that the <<cap_perms_encoding32,RV32 permissions encoding>> does not allocate space for these.

TODO: Should we require execute permission for both RV32 and RV64?
